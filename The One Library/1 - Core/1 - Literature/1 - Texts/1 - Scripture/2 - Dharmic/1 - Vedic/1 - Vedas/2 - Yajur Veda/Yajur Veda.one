							The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the gods, in anticipation of

							of recovering it. They sought violently to take it from him. He wept;
							in that he wept (arodit), that is why Rudra has his name. The tear that
							prospers. He who knows his connexions becomes possessed of connexions
							himself. Agni desiring a share after being established assailed the
							offspring and cattle of the sacrifice. Having removed it, one should
							re-establish it; thus he unites him with his own portion; verily he is
							appeased. He should establish under Punarvasu; Punarvasu is the
							Naksatra for the re-establishing; verily by establishing it under its
							own deity he becomes resplendent. He establishes with Darbha grass, for
							variety. He establishes with Darbha; verily winning it from the waters
							and the plants he establishes it. The sacrificial cake is offered on

							Brahmans desirous of holiness did not aforetime eat his food; the
							Yajyas and Anuvakyas are in the Pankti metre; the sacrifice is
							fivefold, man is fivefold; verily making recompense to the gods for the
							hero he re-establishes the fire does he win him. Now he who removes the
							fire is the slayer of the hero among the gods, Varuna is the exactor of

							with strength', 'Return with wealth', (with these words) he offers
							oblations on either side of the sacrificial cake; verily with strength
							and with wealth he surrounds on either side the sacrificer. The Adityas
							went from this world to yonder world, they were thirsty in yonder

							There is no sacrifice without a Saman. 'As we approach the sacrifice',
							he says; verily he yokes a Stoma with it. 'Approach', he says;
							offspring and cattle approach the world; verily he approaches cattle
							and offspring and this world. 'After his ancient splendour', he says;
							the ancient is the world of heaven; verily he mounts upon the world of
							heaven. 'Agni is the head of the sky, the height', he says; verily he
							makes him the head, he says; man lives a hundred years and has a
							hundred powers; verily he rests on life and power. This is a pipe with
							projections; by it the gods made piercings of hundreds of the Asuras;
							in that he takes up the kindling-stick with this verse, the sacrificer
							hurls the hundred-slaying (verse) as a bolt against his enemy to lay
							(him) low without fail. 'Thou, O Agni, hast attained the radiance of
							the sun', he says; 'that thou art, thus may I be', he says in effect.
							'Thou, O Agni, hast the radiance of the sun', he says; verily he
							invokes this blessing.

							'I gaze on offspring', he says; verily he wins all the domesticated

							they are greatness. 'Ye are might; may I share your might', he says,
							for they are might. 'Ye are strength; may I share your strength', he
							says, who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire. May we (set) thee
							around, O Agni, as a fort', he says; verily he sets around a barrier,
							that nothing be spilt. 'O Agni, lord of the house', he says; that is
							according to the text. 'For a hundred winters', he says; 'for a hundred
							winters may I kindle thee', he says in effect. He utters the name of
							his son; verily he makes him an eater of food. 'This blessing I invoke
							bringing light for the race', he should say, who has no son born;
							verily is born to him a son brilliant and resplendent. 'This blessing I
							invoke bringing light for N. N.', he should say who has a son born;
							verily he confers upon him brilliance and splendour.

							He offers the Agnihotra; whatever there is. of the Sacrificer's own,
							that is (still) his. In the generative organ he pours seed, for Agni is
							the generative organ. Then he burns at the end the plants; they then
							grow more numerous. In that he offers in the evening, he thus pours
							seed, and makes it productive by the morning (offering). Seed when
							poured does not prove fruitful unless modified by Tvastr; as many
							modifications of seed when poured the benediction of him who has
							established a fire; therefore reverence should be paid to the fire.
							Prajapati created cattle; being created they entered day and night; he
							recovered them by means of the metres. In that he pays reverence with
							the metres, he seeks to recover his own. 'There is not monotony then',
							they say, 'if one pays reverence day by day.' If a man pays reverence
							to the fire facing it, it burns him; if with averted (face), he is
							deprived of offspring and cattle; he should pay reverence with (face)
							somewhat to the side, then (the fire) does not burn him, he is not
							deprived of offspring or cattle.

							Even as the Soma (sacrifices) come together in competition, so the new
							and full moon (sacrifices) are sacrifices which come together in
							competition. Whose sacrifice then do the gods approach and whose not?
							He, who among many sacrificers first appropriates the gods, sacrifices
							to them when the next day comes. The Ahavaniya is the abode of the
							gods, between the fires of cattle, the Garhapatya of men, the Anvaharya
							pacana of the fathers. He takes the fire; verily he appropriates; he
							eats of the wild, the wild is power, and so he bestows power upon
							himself. If he were to fast without eating, he would be hungry; if he
							were to eat, Rudra would plan evil against his cattle; he partakes of
							water; that is neither eaten nor not eaten; he is not hungry and Rudra
							does not plot evil against his cattle. The sacrificer is a bolt, the
							enemy of man is hunger; in that he fasts without eating, he straightway
							smites with the bolt the enemy, hunger.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 1: Chapter 6: Verse 8
					-
						-
							He who offers sacrifice without faith, they place not faith in his
							sacrifice. He brings waters forward, the waters are faith; verily with
							faith he offers sacrifice, and both gods and men place faith in his
							sacrifice. They say, 'They foam over the barrier, they foam over
							speech, but over mind they do not foam.' He brings them forward with
							mind; mind is this (earth). Thus he announces the sacrifice to the gods
							and sacrifices, and the gods delight in his sacrifice. This is the
							taking of the sacrifice and so after taking the sacrifice he
							sacrifices. After speaking he remains silent, to support the sacrifice.
							Now Prajapati performed the sacrifice with mind; verily he performs the
							sacrifice with mind to prevent the Raksases following. He who yokes the
							sacrifice when the yoking (time) arrives yokes it indeed among the
							yokers. 'Who (ka) yoketh thee? Let him yoke thee', he says. Ka is
							Prajapati--verily by Prajapati he yokes it; he yokes indeed among the
							yokers.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 1: Chapter 6: Verse 9
					-
						-
							Prajapati created the sacrifices, the Agnihotra, the Agnistoma, the
							full moon sacrifice, the Ukthya, the new moon sacrifice and the
							Atiratra. These he meted out; the Agnistoma was the size of the
							Agnihotra, the Ukthya that of the full moon sacrifice, the Atiratra
							that of the new moon sacrifice. He who knowing thus offers the
							Agnihotra obtains as much as by offering the Agnistoma; he who knowing
							thus offers the full moon sacrifice obtains as much as by offering the
							Ukthya he puts on the fire and the melted butter; he throws the clump
							of grass, and gathers it in; he surrounds the Vedi and he girds the
							wife (of the sacrificer); he puts in place the anointing waters and the
							melted butter. These are the twelve pairs in the new and full moon
							sacrifices. He, who thus sacrifices with these, sacrifices with an
							abundant offering and is multiplied with offspring, with cattle, with
							pairings.

							'Thou I art secure; may I be secure among my equals', he says; verily
							he makes them secure.' 'Thou art dread; may I be dread among my
							equals'; verily he makes them harmonious. 'Thou art overcoming; may I
							be overcoming among my equals,' he says; verily he overthrows him who
							rises against him. 'I yoke thee with the divine Brahman', he says; this
							is the yoking of the fire; verily, with mind and true existence do thou
							enter me', he says; mind is derived from Prajapati, the sacrifice is
							derived from Prajapati; verily he confers upon himself mind and the
							sacrifice. 'Thou art speech, derived from Indra, destroying the foe; do
							thou enter me with speech, with power', he says; speech is derived from
							Indra; verily he confers upon himself speech as connected with Indra.
						-

						Section 2 - Black: Book 1: Chapter 6: Verse 11

						-
							He who knows the seventeenfold Prajapati as connected with the
							sacrifice rests secure through the sacrifice, and falls not away from
							the sacrifice. 'Do thou proclaim' has four syllables; 'Be it
							proclaimed' has four syllables; 'Utter' has two syllables; 'We that do
							utter' has five syllables; the Vasat has two syllables; this is the
							seventeenfold Prajapati as connected with the sacrifice; he who knows
							thus rests secure through the sacrifice and does not fall away from the
							sacrifice. He who knows the beginning, the support, the end of the
							sacrifice he confers the eating of food upon himself. 'Thou art a
							deceiver; may I be undeceived; may I deceive N. N.', he says; by that
							deceit the gods deceived the Asuras; verily by this he deceives his
							foe. 'By sacrifice to the gods, Agni and Soma, may I be a slayer of
							foes', he says; by means of Agni and Soma Indra slew Vrtra; verily by
							means of them he lays low his foe. 'By sacrifice to the gods, Indra and
							Agni, may I be powerful and an eater of food', he says; verily he
							becomes powerful and an eater of food. 'By sacrifice to the god Indra,
							may I be powerful', he says; verily he becomes powerful. 'By sacrifice
							to the god Mahendra, may I attain superiority and greatness', he says;
							verily he attains superiority and greatness. 'By sacrifice to the god
							Agni Svistakrt, may I attain security through the sacrifice, enjoying
							long life', he says; verily he confers long life upon himself and
							attains security through the sacrifice.

							Cattle attend the cooked offerings of him who has established a fire.
							The cooked offering is the Ida; it is placed in the world of the
							sacrifice between the fore- and the after-offerings. Over it as it is
							brought up he should say, 'O thou of fair rain colour, come hither';
							the cattle are the Ida; verily he summons cattle. The gods milked the
							sacrifice, the sacrifice milked the Asuras; the Asuras, being milked by
							the sacrifice, were defeated; he, who knowing the milking of the
							sacrifice sacrificial fee which he gives at the sacrifice his cattle
							accompany; he having sacrificed is like to become without cattle; 'the
							sacrificer must so arrange', they say, 'that he may place among the
							gods what is given, but keep his cattle with himself.' 'Swell, O ruddy
							one', he says; the ruddy one is the sacrifice; verily he magnifies the
							sacrifice; thus he places among the gods what is given, but keeps his
							cattle with himself. 'May (my act) as I give be not destroyed', he
							says; verily he avoids destruction; 'May (my act) as I work not
							perish', he says; verily he attains prosperity.

							Samçravas Sauvarcanasa said to Tumiñja Aupoditi: 'When thou hast been a
							Hotr of Sattrins, what Ida hast thou invoked?' 'Her I have invoked', he
							said, 'who supports the gods by her expiration, men by her
							cross-breathing, and the Pitrs by her inspiration.' 'Does she divide,
							or does she not divide' (he asked). 'She divides', he replied. 'Her
							body then hast thou invoked', he said. Her body is the cow, this
							(earth) supports people in distress and succours them as they improve;
							he who knows thus finds support. 'Her too I have invoked', he said, 'in
							whose step people drink the ghee they live upon.' 'Does she divide, or
							does she not divide?' (he asked). 'She does not divide', he said, 'but
							she propagates.' 'Indeed hast thou invoked the Ida herself ', he
							replied. The Ida is rain; in the step of rain people drink the ghee
							they live upon; he who knows thus is propagated with offspring; he
							becomes an eater of food.

							Secretly offering is made to one set of gods, openly to another. The
							gods who receive offering secretly, he thus offers to them in
							sacrifice; in that he brings the Anvaharya mess--the Brahmans are the
							gods openly--them he verily delights. This is his sacrificial fee:
							verily he mends the rent in the sacrifice; whatever in the sacrifice is
							harsh or is injured, that he makes good (anvaharati), he says; verily
							he unites Prajapati with his own portion. 'Full of strength and milk',
							he says; verily he confers upon him strength and milk. 'Protect my
							expiration and inspiration; protect my breathing together and
							cross-breathing', he says; verily he invokes this blessing. 'Thou art
							imperishable, for imperishableness thee; mayst thou not perish for me,
							yonder, in yonder world', he says. Food perishes in yonder world, for
							given hence in yonder world people live upon it; in that he touches
							thus, he makes it imperishable; his food perishes not in yonder world.

							'By I sacrifice to the divine strew, may I be possessed of children',

							offspring. 'By sacrifice to the god Naraçansa, may I be possessed of
							cattle', he says; by Naraçansa Prajapati created cattle; verily he
							creates cattle. 'By sacrifice to the god, Agni Svistakrt, may I attain
							security through the sacrifice, having long life', he says; verily he
							confers life on himself, and finds support through the sacrifice. With
							the victory of the new and full moon sacrifices, may I impregnate
							seed', he says; Soma is the impregnator of seed; verily he confers seed
							upon himself. 'By sacrifice to the god Tvastr, may I prosper the form
							of cattle'; Tvastr is the form-maker of the pairings of cattle, and
							thereby he confers upon himself the form of cattle. 'The wives of the
							gods, Agni, the lord of the house, are the pair of the sacrifice; by
							sacrifice to these deities may I be propagated with a pair.' 'Thou art
							the bundle, thou art gain, may I gain', he says; by the bundle (vedena)
							the gods won (avindanta) the desirable wealth of the Asuras, and that
							is why the bundle has its name. Whatever of his foe's he may covet, the
							name of that he should utter; verily he wing it all from him. 'May the
							bundle bestow increase of wealth, rich in ghee, rich in houses, a
							thousandfold, strong', he says; he obtains a thousand cattle. In his
							offspring a strong one is born who knows thus.

							Through the emptying of the Dhruva the sacrifice is emptied, through
							the sacrifice the sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. Through
							the swelling of the Dhruva, the sacrifice is made to swell, through the
							sacrifice the sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. 'Let the
							Dhruva swell with ghee', he says; verily he makes the Dhruva to swell;
							through its swelling the sacrifice is made to swell, through the
							sacrifice the sacri ficer, throuo - h the sacrificer offspring.
							'Prajapati's is the world called Vibhan. In it I place thee along with
							the sacrificer', he says. He goes to the bath along with the creatures

							these worlds by the metres so as to be irrecoverable; in that he takes
							the steps of Visnu the sacrificer becoming Visnu wins these worlds by
							the metres so as to be irrecoverable. 'Thou art the step of Visnu,
							smiting imprecations', he says; the earth is the Gayatri, the
							atmosphere is connected with the Tristubh, the sky is the Jagati, the
							quarters are connected with the Anustubh; verily by the metres he wins

							of rays; thou art life-bestowing, bestow life upon me', he says; verily
							he invokes this blessing. He falls away from this world, who, for
							atonement, to prevent burning. The sacrifice goes away, and turns not
							back; to him who sacrifices knowing the restoration of the sacrifice it
							does turn back; 'The sacrifice hath become, it hath come into being',
							he says; this is the restoration of the sacrifice, and thereby he
							restores it. Excellence has not been obtained by him who having
							established a fire has no retinue; cattle indeed are the retinue of a
							Brahman. Having sacrificed, he should step forward to the east and say,
							'Rich in cattle, in sheep, O Agni, in horses is the sacrificer'; he
							wins his retinue, he obtains a thousand cattle, in his offspring a

							supported he attains prosperity to avoid being burnt; he prospers. He
							who desires cattle should offer one of a triplet to Soma and Pusan; the
							she-goat has two teats, two are born separately, the third for strength
							and growth. Verily he has recourse to Soma and Pusan with their own
							share; verily they produce cattle for him; Soma is the depositor of

							Purohitaship should offer (a beast) with a black neck to Agni, a brown
							one to Soma, and one with a black neck to Agni; the Brahman is
							connected with Agni, the prince with Soma; on either side of (the

							a spot on its forehead and horns bent forward to Indra, the angry, the
							wise; the enemy is the evil; verily he has recourse to Indra, the
							overcomer of enemies with his own share, and he drives away from him
							the enemy, the evil. He who being meet for kingship obtains not a
							kingdom should offer (a beast) with a spot on the forehead and horns
							bent forward to Indra of the thunderbolt. Verily he has recourse to

							The gods, men, and the Pitrs were on one side, the Asuras, Raksases,

							Raksases smothered by the nights and dawn dawned on them smothered and
							dead. The gods understood, 'Him who of us dies, it is the Raksases who

							repels thereby the foe who is superior to him; in that (he offers) to
							Agni, the overcomer, he repels thereby (the foe) who is equal to him;

							in conflict sacrifice with this offering. To Agni, the gatherer, he

							(fire), saying, 'Hail! wax great, Indra's foe. While (the fire) was
							flaming upwards to strike, just then of itself it stayed; whether so
							much was before knows this slays the enemy hunger. He gave it to him;
							he accepted it, and (saying), 'Thrice hast thou furthered me', gave it
							to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), 'Let Indra place power in us.' In
							that thrice he gave and thrice he accepted, that is the reason of the
							threefold character of the threefold. In that Visnu aided him and he
							gave (it) to Visnu, therefore the offering belongs to Indra and Visnu.
							Whatever there is here he gave to him, the Rces, the Samans, the

								Viçvarupa, son of Tvastr, was the domestic priest of the gods, and
								the sister's son of the Asuras. He had three heads, one which drank
								Soma, one Sura, and one which ate food. He promised openly the
								share to the gods, secretly to the Asuras. Men promise openly the
								share to every one; if they promise any one secretly, his share is
								indeed promised. Therefore Indra was afraid (thinking), 'Such an
								one is diverting the sovereignty (from me).' He took his bolt and
								smote off his heads. (The head) which drank Soma anoints herself
								has a skin disease; (the son born) of one who combs her hair is
								bald and feeble; (the son born) of one who anoints (her eyes) is
								blind; (the son born) of one who cleans her teeth has dirty teeth;
								(the son born) of one who cuts her nails has bad nails; (the son
								born) of one who spins is a eunuch; (the son born) of one who
								weaves ropes is unrestrained; (the son born) of one who drinks from
								a leaf is drunken; (the son born) of one who drinks from a
								mutilated (vessel) is mutilated. For three nights he should keep a
								vow and should drink from his hand or from a perfect vessel, to
								guard his offspring.

							Tvastr, his son being slain, offered Soma excluding Indra. Indra
							desired an invitation to the rite, but he did not invite him; (saying)
							'Thou hast slain my son.' He made a disturbance of the sacrifice, and
							forcibly drank the Soma. The remains of it Tvastr cast upon the
							Ahavaniya (fire), (saying), 'Hail! wax great, Indra's foe.' In that he
							cast it (avartayat), Vrtra is Vrtra; in that he said, 'Hail! wax great,
							Indra's foe', therefore, 'Let me choose a boon; ye shall feed off both
							when they are in me.' The cow brought the (brilliance); therefore they
							feed off both things that are in the cow; ghee indeed is the brilliance
							of Agni, milk the brilliance of Soma. He who knows thus the brilliance
							of Agni and Soma becomes brilliant. The theologians say, 'What is the
							deity of the full moon (rite)?' He should reply, 'Prajapati; by means
							of it he established his eldest son, Indra.' Therefore they establish
							their eldest sons with wealth.

							When Indra had slain Vrtra, his enemies threatened him. He saw this
							enemy-dispelling (oblation) to be offered subsequently at the full
							moon. He offered it, and with it drove away his enemies. In that the
							enemy-dispelling (oblation) is to be offered subsequently at the full
							moon, the sacrificer by it drives away his enemies. Indra, having slain
							Vrtra, lost the gods and his power. He saw the (offering) to Agni on
							eight potsherds at the new moon, and the curds for Indra dwells', for
							Indra is the treasure of the gods, and that is why the new moon night
							has its name (ama-vasya), 'home dwelling'). The theologians say, What
							is the deity of the Samnayya?' 'The All-gods', he should reply, for so
							the All-gods won that as their share.' Or rather he should reply,
							'Indra, for it was in healing Indra that they won it.'

					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 2: Chapter 5: Verse 4
					-
						-
							The theologians say, 'He would indeed offer the new and full moon
							(sacrifices) who should offer them with Indra.' At the full moon there
							is the subsequent offering of the enemy-dispelling (oblation), and by
							it the full moon has Indra. There are curds for Indra at the new moon;
							verily the new moon has Indra. He who knowing thus offers,' the new and
							full moon sacrifices, offers them with Indra, and day after day it
							becomes better for him who has so sacrificed. What the gods did at the
							sacrifice, the Asuras did. The gods his own deity, being sacrificed to,
							kindles him with prosperity and he becomes richer. After the year he
							should offer a cake on eight potsherds to Agni, lord of vows; verily
							for a year Agni, lord of vows, causes him to take up the vow who has
							slain his foe (vrtra). Thereafter he may sacrifice at will.

							No one who is not a Soma sacrificer should offer the Samnayya. For the
							milk of him who is not a Soma sacrificer is imperfect, and if one who
							is not a Soma sacrificer offers the Samnayya he is a thief and does
							wrong, and (his milk) is poured forth in vain. A Soma sacrificer only
							should offer the Samnayya. Soma is milk, the Samnayya is milk; verily
							with milk he places milk in himself. The moon deprives him of offspring
							and cattle, and makes his enemy wax great on whose sacrifice when
							offered it rises in the east. Just as a great man who has attained
							(fortune) desires (and does), so he does. If he misses the mark he
							becomes worse; if he does not, he remains the same. One who desires
							distinction should sacrifice with it, for this sacrifice has a razor
							edge, and swiftly he becomes holy or perishes. His vow is: he shall not
							speak untruth; be shall not eat meat; he shall not approach for all a
							woman; they shall not clean his raiment with cleansing stuff; for all
							these things the gods do not do.

							The new and the full moon (sacrifices) are the chariot of the gods. He,
							who having offered the new and the full moon (sacrifices) Sacrifices
							with Soma, rests in the chosen resting-place of the gods which is
							conspicuous for its chariot (tracks). The new and the full moons are
							the limbs and joints of the year; he who knowing thus offers the new
							and the full moon (sacrifices) thus unites the limbs and joints of the
							year. The new and the full moon are the eyes of the year; he who
							knowing thus offers the new and the full moon (sacrifices) thus sees
							with them along the world of heaven; from us let the gods be sacrificed
							to.' Therefore of the series of nights it is on the new and the full
							moon night that the gods are sacrificed to; for they are the appointers
							of portions for the gods. Men appoint portions to him who knows thus.
							Creatures slew hunger, man at once, the gods at the half-month, the
							Pitrs in a month, trees in a year. Therefore day by day men desire
							food, at the half-month the gods are sacrificed to, every month
							offering is made to the Pitrs, in a year trees produce fruit. He who
							knows thus slays the enemy, hunger.

							The gods could not rest on the Rc or the Yajus. On the Saman only could
							they rest. He makes the noise 'Him'; verily he makes the Saman. He
							makes the noise 'Him'; where the gods rested, there he sets them in
							motion. He makes the noise 'Him'; this is the yoking of speech. He
							makes the noise 'Him'; thus the sacrificers produce offspring. He
							repeats the first (verse) thrice, the last thrice; verily he ties the
							end of the sacrifice. Verily by expiration does he make steadfast his
							inspiration, and he lives all his days. He, who knows the elbow of the
							Samidhenis, puts his enemy in his elbow. He joins the half-verses; this
							is the elbow of the Samidhenis; he who knows thus puts his foe in his
							elbow. The Samidhenis were brought out by Rsi after Rsi; if they were
							not connected together, they would go away from the sacrificer's
							offspring and cattle. He unites the half-verses; verily he connects
							them together, and being so connected and secured they yield him all
							his desires.

							Without a Saman there is no sacrifice. 'O Agni, come hither for the
							feast', he says; this is the character of the Rathantara. 'Thee with
							the kindling-sticks, O Angiras', he says; this is the character of the
							Vamadevya. 'The great and powerful one, O Agni', he says. This is the
							character of the Brhat. In that he repeats this Trca, he makes the
							sacrifice have Samans. Agni was in yonder world, the sun in this; these
							worlds were disturbed. 'Choose ye the bearer of the oblation', he says;
							'let him choose him who is of the gods. He chooses one of a Rsi's
							family; verily he departs not from the connexion, (and so it serves)
							for continuity. He chooses, beginning at the further end, in order of
							descent; therefore the Pitrs drink after men in order of descent,
							beginning at the further end.

							'O Agni, thou art great', he says, for Agni is great. 'O Brahman', he

							sacrifice to the gods. 'Kindled by the gods', he says, for the gods
							kindled him. 'Kindled by Manu', he says, for Manu kindled him after the
							gods. 'Praised by the Rsis', he says, for the Rsis praised him.
							'Rejoiced in by sages', he says. If he were to say two as it were, he
							would produce an enemy for him. 'Take, Adhvaryu, the spoon (sruc) with
							ghee', he says; verily by it he causes the sacrificer to wax great.
							'Pious', he says, for he aids the gods, 'With all boons', he says, for
							he aids all. 'Let us praise the gods worthy of praise; let us honour
							those worthy of honour; let us sacrifice to those worthy of sacrifice',
							he says. Those worthy of praise are men; those worthy of honour are the
							Pitrs; those worthy of sacrifice are the gods; verily he sacrifices to
							the deities according to their portions.

							In the case of a Rajanya let him repeat the Trcas thrice three other
							sorts of men are there besides the warrior, the Brahman, Vaiçya and
							Çudra; verily he makes them obedient to him. He should repeat fifteen
							(Samidhenis) in the case of a Rajanya; the Rajanya is fifteenfold;
							verily he makes him find support in his own Stoma. Let him surround it
							with a Tristubh; the Tristubh is power, the Rajanya sacrifices in
							desire of power; verily by the Tristubh he secures power for him. If he
							desires. He should repeat forty-four for one who desires power, the
							Tristubh has forty-four syllables, the Tristubh is power; verily by the
							Tristubh he secures power for him. He should repeat forty-eight for one
							who desires cattle; the Jagati has forty-eight syllables, cattle are
							connected with the Jagati; verily with the Jagati he secures cattle for
							him. He should repeat all the metres for one who makes many sacrifices,
							for all the metres are won by him who makes many sacrifices. He should
							repeat indefinitely to win that which is not definite.

							The thread is worn around the neck for men, over the right shoulder for
							the Pitrs, over the left for the gods. He puts it over the left
							shoulder; verily he makes the mark of the gods. He repeats standing,
							for standing he speaks more audibly. He repeats standing, to conquer
							the world of heaven. He sacrifices sitting; verily he finds support in
							this world. In that he repeats in the Krauñca, note, that is connected
							with the Asuras, in the low note, that is connected with men, in the
							intermediate note, that is connected with the gods. One should repeat
							in the intermediate note, to secure the gods. Clever indeed; verily
							also the world of the gods and the world of men he conquers.
						-
						-
							The gods having repeated the Samidhenis could not see the sacrifice.
							Prajapati in silence performed the sprinkling of the butter. Then
							indeed did the gods see the sacrifice. In that he silently sprinkles,
							(it serves) to light up the sacrifice. Verily also he anoints the
							kindling-sticks. He who knows thus becomes soft. Verily also he
							delights them. He delights in offspring and cattle prospered, the
							Asuras were defeated. The man, who knows thus and for whom they chose
							his list of ancestors, prospers himself, his enemy is defeated. If a
							Brahman and a non-Brahman have a litigation, one should support the
							Brahman; if one supports the Brahman, one supports oneself; if one
							opposes the Brahman, one opposes oneself therefore one should not
							oppose a Brahman.

							He offers to the kindling-sticks; verily he wins spring among the

							offers to the oblations; verily he wins the rains. He offers to the
							sacrificial strew, verily lie wins autumn. He offers with the cry of
							'Hail!'; verily he wins the winter. Therefore in winter animals over
							which the cry of 'Hail!' is raised perish. He offers to the
							kindling-sticks; verily he wins the dawns of the goddesses. He offers
							to Tanunapat; verily he wins the sacrifice. Therefore they say, who
							know it or who know not, 'How is it the son's only, how is the father's

							sacrificer discerns the world of the gods, by Soma the world of the
							Pitrs; in the north part he offers to Agni, in the south to Soma, for
							these worlds are thus, as it were, to illumine these worlds. Agni and
							Soma are the kings of the gods establishes him with the Vasat call. The
							Puronuvakya has three feet; these worlds are three; verily he finds
							support in these worlds. The Yajya has four feet; verily he wins four
							footed cattle. The Vasat call has two syllables, the sacrificer has two
							feet; verily afterwards he finds support in cattle. The Puronuvakya is
							the Gayatri, the Yajya, the Tristubh, and this is the sevenfooted

							Therefore they offer the portions of the oblation, they pour out (a

							The Açvins are the physicians of the gods; verily by them he heals it.

							altar was rough, hairless, and impure; verily he makes it pure. 'To the

						-
							Agni had three elder brothers; they perished while carrying the
							offering to the gods. Agni was afraid, 'Thus indeed will this one fall
							on misfortune.' He ran away, and entered the waters. The gods sought to
							start him up. The fish proclaimed him, and he cursed it, 'At Pleasure
							may they slay thee, since thou hast proclaimed me.' So they slay the
							fish at pleasure, for he is cursed quarter; verily he appeases Rudra in
							his own quarter. He sprinkles it twice, to make it divided into four.
							The former offerings are cattle, Agni is Rudra here; if he were to pour
							over the former offerings, he would give Rudra cattle, and the
							sacrificer would be without cattle. He offers leaving the former
							oblations aside, to protect the cattle.

							Manu desired what of earth was sacrificial. He found the poured out
							ghee. He said, 'Who is able to produce this also at the sacrifice?'
							Mitra and Varuna said, 'We are able to produce the cow.' Then they set
							the cow in motion. Wherever she stepped, there ghee was pressed out;
							therefore she is called ghee-footed; that is her origin. 'The
							Rathantara is invoked with the earth', he says, he says. The highest
							sacrifice is offspring, the greater offering is cattle, the divine
							abode is the world of heaven. (With the words), 'Thou art this; thou
							art this', he invokes the dear abode of the sacrifice. 'All that is
							dear to it is invoked', he says; verily not vainly does he invoke.

							Food is cattle, he takes it himself; verily by himself he fills his
							desires of cattle, for no one else can grant him his desire of cattle.
							'Thee offered to the lord of speech I eat', he says; verily he delights
							speech with a share. 'Thee offered to the lord of the Sadas I eat', he
							says, for completion.' (The food) is divided. in four; what is divided
							in four is the offering, what is divided in four is cattle; if the Hotr
							were to eat it, the Hotr would, 'It will harm me when I have eaten.'
							'With the belly of the Brahman', he said, for nothing harms the belly
							of the Brahman. 'With the holy power (Brahman) of Brhaspati', (he
							said), for he is fullest of the holy power (Brahman). The breaths
							indeed depart from him who eats this offering; by purifying it with
							water he grasps the breaths; the breaths are ambrosia, the waters
							ambrosia; verily he summons the breaths according to their places.

							He takes a portion for the Agnidh; verily he delights the seasons whose
							mouth is Agni. He takes a kindling-stick, for the support of the
							subsequent offerings; verily he pours on that which has a kindling
							stick. He rubs the enclosing-sticks; verily he purifies them. He rubs
							each once, for the sacrifice there is as it were turned away. It makes
							up four, cattle are four-footed; verily he wins cattle. 'O Brahman,
							will we set out?' he says; there indeed is the sacrifice placed. 'Agni
							shall win, god, from the gods, we men from Agni', he says, 'Agni wins
							from the gods, we from men', he says in effect. 'Here is the path of
							favour, and this our homage to the gods', he says; to both the gods
							whom he sacrifices to and those to whom he does not sacrifice, he pays
							homage, for his own security.

							The gods could not find any one to utter the call Svaga at the
							sacrifice. They spoke to Çamyu Barhaspatya, 'Perform the Svaga call at
							this sacrifice for us.' He said, 'Let me choose a boon; if a faithless
							man sacrifice, or a man sacrifices without prescription, let the
							blessing of such a sacrificer be mine.' Therefore if a faithless man
							sacrifices, or a man sacrifices without prescription, the blessing of
							such a sacrifice goes to Çamyu Barhaspatya. 'That is mine', he said,
							'What is to belong to my offspring? in that the fore-sacrifices are
							offered with butter, and the sacrifices to the wives (are offered) with
							butter. Having repeated the Rc, of the sacrifices to the wives he
							offers with a Rc, to prevent sameness, and to make a pairing. The
							sacrifice has a fivefold prelude and a fivefold end; there are offered
							five fore-sacrifices; there are four sacrifices to the wives, the fifth
							is the Samistayajus by they make up five as a prelude, and five as an
							end.

							Prajapati desired, 'May I create offspring.' He did penance, he created

							penance a third time, he saw this speech of the consecrated, he spoke

							penance he speaks the speech of the consecrated, the sacrificer thus.
							'From good to better do thou advance; may Brhaspati be thy forerunner',

							grasps hold of him, and he brings him safely through. 'Here we have
							come (a-idam) to the place on earth for sacrifice to the gods', he
							says, for he comes to the place on earth for sacrifice, who sacrifices.
							'Wherein aforetime all the gods rejoiced', he says, for all the gods
							delight in it, in that the Brahmans so do. 'Accomplishing (the rite)
							with Rc, Saman, and Yajus', he says, for he who sacrifices accomplishes

							supported, the hymns are not supported, the sacrificer is not
							supported, the Adhvaryu is not supported. The support of the Soma is
							the Vayu cup, the support of it is the beaker, (the support) of the

							they make the carts follow after. Now the altar of him (Agni) is
							deserted; he broods on it, and is liable to become terrible (rudrá),
							and lay to rest the offspring and cattle of the sacrificer. When they
							are leading northward the sacrificial animal over which the Apris have
							been said, he should take (from the altar the fire) for cooking it;
							verily he makes him share in it. The Ahavaniya is the sacrificer; if
							they take (the fire) for cooking the victim from the Ahavaniya, they
							tear the sacrificer asunder; the fire should therefore be thus, or he
							should make it by friction, so that the sacrificer's body may remain
							together. If a portion of the victim be lost, he should cut off an
							equivalent portion of the butter; that is then the atonement. If men
							disturb his victim and he wish of them, 'May they come to ruin', he
							should make an offering in the Agnidh's altar with the Rc containing
							the word 'paying of homage' (and beginning), 'What then?' Verily he
							appropriates their paying of homage and speedily do they go to ruin.

							The breath of the sacrifice is apart from the victim', he says, for

							offers a libation, for calming. 'O ye slayers, come to the sacrifices',
							he says; that is according to the text. When the omentum. is being
							taken, the strength goes away from Agni. 'Thee they keep to carry the
							offering'--(with these words) he pours a libation over the omentum;
							verily he wins the strength of Agni; (it serves) also for making (the
							victim) ready. In the case of some gods the cry of 'hail!' is uttered
							before (an offering), in the case of others the cry of 'hail!' is
							uttered after. 'Hail to the gods, to the gods hail!'--(with these
							words) he pours a libation on either side of the omentum; verily he
							delights both (sets of gods).

							In that the Hotr addresses the Adhvaryu, he makes the thunder bolt
							advance towards him; 'O reciter of hymns', he says in response at the
							morning pressing; the syllables herein are three, the Gayatri has three
							Padas, the morning pressing is connected with the Gayatri; verily with
							the Gayatri he places the thunderbolt within the morning pressing. 'The
							hymn hath been uttered', he says in response at the midday pressing;
							the syllables herein are four, the Tristubh has four Padas, the midday
							pressing is connected with the Tristubh; verily with the Tristubh he
							places the thunderbolt within the midday pressing, for yonder (sky)
							stands as it were; verily thereby the sacrificer milks yonder (sky). In
							that he recites sitting, therefore the gods live on that which is given
							hence; in that he responds standing, therefore men live on what is
							given thence. In that he recites seated towards the east, and he
							responds standing towards the west, therefore seed is impregnated in
							front, offspring are born behind. In that the Hotr addresses the
							Adhvaryu, he makes the thunderbolt advance towards him; he turns
							towards the West; verily he overcomes the thunderbolt.

							he who knows thus sings what ever he sings with the metres in full
							strength. 'In that Indra, slew Vrtra, there is impurity, in that he

							Çipivista; Visnu Çipivista is the redundancy of the sacrifice, the

							(verily it serves) to connect it with its place of birth. 'May Aditi
							thee', he says; Aditi is this (earth); verily with Aditi in Aditi he
							digs, to avoid injury to it, for one hurts not oneself. 'May the wives
							of the gods thee', he says; the wives of the gods made it first, he
							says; therefore Agni shines along all the quarters. 'Arise, become
							great, stand upright, be thou firm', he says, for support. A bowl that
							is not poured upon is connected with the Asuras; he pours upon it;
							verily he makes it to be with the gods; with goats' milk he pours upon
							it; the milk of the goat is the highest form of draught; verily he
							pours upon it with the highest draught; (he pours) with a Yajus, for

							quarter foot is deficient by one syllable; therefore men live upon the
							incomplete part of speech. He offers with a full (one), for Prajapati
							is full as it were; (verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati. He puts on
							(a stick) of Vikankata wood; verily he wins radiance; he puts on one of
							Çami, for atonement. 'Do thou sit down in the lap of this mother', with
							three (verses) he adores (the fire) when born; three are these worlds;
							verily he attains reputation in these worlds; verily also he bestows
							breaths on himself.

							Formerly Agni would not burn what was not cut by the axe, but Prayoga,
							the seer, made that acceptable to him. 'Whatever logs we place on
							thee', (with these words) he puts on a kindling-stick; verily he makes
							what is not cut by the axe acceptable to him; all is acceptable to him
							who knows thus. He puts on one of Udumbara wood; the Udumbara is
							strength; verily he confers strength upon him. Prajapati created Agni;
							him on creation the Raksases he supports him with the breaths. Sitting
							he puts (it) on; therefore offspring are born sitting; the black
							antelope skin is above; gold is brilliance, the black antelope skin is
							holy power; verily on both sides he encircles him, with brilliance and
							with holy power. The sling is of six fathoms in extent; the seasons are
							six; verily he raises him with the seasons; if it is of twelve fathoms,
							(he raises him) with the year. It is of Muñja grass; the Muñja is
							strength; verily he unites him with strength. 'Thou art the bird of

							first brick that is put down obstructs the breath of cattle and of the
							sacrificer; it is a naturally perforated one, to permit the breath to
							pass, and also to reveal the world of heaven. 'In the fire must the

							(the fire) enters the navel of the sacrificer, and is liable to injure
							him. He puts down the mortar; this is the navel of the fire; verily he
							piles the fire with its navel, to avoid injury. (The mortar) is of
							Udumbara wood; the Udumbara is strength; verily he wins strength; in
							the middle he puts it down; verily in the middle he bestows strength
							upon him; therefore in the middle men enjoy strength. So large is it,
							commensurate with Prajapati, the mouth of the sacrifice. He pounds;
							verily he makes food; he puts (it) down with (a verse) addressed to

							form of Agni Vaiçvanara; verily by his form he wins Vaiçvanara. If he
							desire of a man, 'May he become hungry', he should put down for one (a
							pan) deficient in size. If he were to put it down looking with the
							heads of the animals, (the snakes) would bite the animals of the
							village; if turned away, those of the wild; he should speak a Yajus, he
							wins the brilliance that is in the snake, he injures not the animals of

							that he puts down, thereby he wins the brilliance that is in the
							serpent; in that he utters a Yajus, thereby is it appeased.

							verily he produces cattle for him; five on the south, the water bricks
							are the thunderbolt; verily with the thunderbolt he smites away the
							Raksases from the south of the sacrifice; five he puts down on the west
							is not worthy of heaven; the fire is worthy of heaven; in that he puts
							down the unifying (bricks), he unifies it; verily he makes it worthy of
							heaven. 'The eighteen-month-old calf the strength, the Krta of throws

							By the 'sitters on the vault' the gods went to the world of heaven;
							that is why the 'sitters on the vault' have their name. In that he puts
							down the 'sitters on the vault', the sacrificer thus goes by the
							'sitters on the vault' to the world of heaven; the vault is the world
							of heaven; for him for whom these are put down there is no misfortune
							(ná-ákam); the 'sitters on the vault' are the home of the sacrificer;
							in that he puts down the 'sitters on the vault', the sacrificer thus
							makes himself a home. The 'sitters on the vault' are the collected
							brilliance of the Prstha (Stotras); in that he puts down the 'sitters
							on the vault' and of the sacrificer; there fore no other brick should
							be put down higher. He puts down the naturally perforated brick; the
							naturally perforated brick is yonder (sky); verily he puts down yonder
							(sky). He makes the horse sniff it; verily be places breath in it;
							again the horse is connected with Prajapati; verily by Prajapati he
							piles the fire. It is naturally perforated, to let out the breaths, and
							also to light up the world of heaven. The earless is the triumph of the
							gods; in that he puts down the earless, he triumphs with the triumph of
							the gods; to the north he puts it down; therefore to the north of the
							fire is action carried on; (the verse) has the word 'wind', for
							kindling.

							down the Gayatris on the east; the Gayatri is brilliance; verily at the
							beginning he places brilliance; verily he wins various cattle; variety
							is seen in his house for whom these are put down, and who knows them
							thus. He puts down an Atichandas; all the metres are the Atichandas;

							For all the gods is the fire piled up; if he were not to put (them)

							sinews, so is the fire held together by these (bricks). By the fire the
							gods went to the world of heaven; they became yonder Krttikas; he for
							whom these are put down goes to the world of heaven, attains

							bricks; the circular bricks are these worlds; the citadels of the gods
							are these worlds; verily he enters the citadels of the gods; he is not
							ruined who has piled up the fire. He puts down the all-light (bricks);
							verily by them he makes these worlds full of light; verily also they
							support the breaths of the sacrificer; they are the deities of heaven;

							their name; in that he puts down the Samyanis, just as one goes in the
							waters with a ship, so, and also with brilliance. He places (them)
							after carrying (them) round; verily he confers upon him brilliance not
							to be removed. Prajapati piled up the fire, he lost his glory, he saw
							these bestowers of glory, he put them down; verily with them he
							conferred glory upon himself; five he puts down; man is fivefold;

							says; verily with him to aid he encircles him. 'Be thou, O Agni, among
							those of the five races.' The fire of the five layers is the fire of
							the five races; therefore he speaks thus. He puts down the seasonal
							(bricks); the seasonal (bricks) are the abode dear to the seasons;

							The eye of Prajapati swelled, that fell away, that became a horse;
							because it swelled (áçvayat), that is the reason why the horse (áçva)
							has its name. By the horse sacrifice the gods replaced it. He who
							sacrifices with the horse sacrifice makes Prajapati whole; verily he
							becomes whole; this is the atonement for everything, and the cure for
							everything. All evil by it the gods overcame; by it also the gods
							overcame (the sins of) Brahman- slaying; all evil he overcomes, he
							overcomes Brahman-slaying who sacrifices with the horse sacrifice, and
							he who knows it thus. It was the left eye of Prajapati that swelled;
							therefore they cut off from the horse on the left side, on the right
							from other animals. The mat is of reeds; the horse has its birthplace
							in the waters, the reed is born in the waters; verily he establishes it
							in its own birthplace. The Stoma is the fourfold one; the bee tore the
							thigh of the horse, the gods made it whole with the fourfold Stoma; in
							that there is the fourfold Stoma, (it is) to make whole the horse.

							The gods and the Asuras were in conflict, they could not decide the

							sacrificer with them bestows on himself power, strength, and body;
							verily also he piles up the fire with Indra and with a body; be
							prospers himself, his foe is to light up the world of heaven. If he
							were to place them in contact, he would obstruct the world of rain,
							Parjanya would not rain; he puts them down without touching; verily he

							puts down some pointing west, on the west some pointing east; therefore

							He puts down the seasonal (bricks), to arrange the seasons. He puts

							seasonal (bricks) are the internal cement of the layers; in that he
							puts down the seasonal (bricks), (it is) to keep apart the layers. He
							puts down next an Avaka plant; this is the birthplace of Agni; verily
							he piles up the fire with its birthplace; moreover he unites it with
							its form, and with golden light he goes to the world of heaven. He
							anoints with that which contains the word 'of a thousand'; Prajapati is
							of a thousand; (verily it serves) to win Prajapati. 'May these bricks,

							with all five together, his fire yoked would fall away, the libations
							would be without support, the Stomas without support, the hymns without

							succeed by the piling up of the fire re-piles it. In that he piles up
							the fire, (it is) for prosperity. Or rather they say, 'one should not
							pile it up.' The fire is Rudra, and it is as if one stirs up a sleeping
							lion. But again they say, 'One should pile it up.' It is as if one
							awakens a richer man with his due portion. Manu piled the fire; with it

							in heron form who desires, 'May I be possessed of a head in yonder
							world'; verily he becomes possessed of a head in yonder world. He
							should pile in the form of an Alaja bird, with four furrows, who
							desires support; there are four quarters; verily he finds support in

							verily in his abode he wins for him power and strength. Twelve he puts

							Jagati; verily with the Jagati he wins cattle for him. Eight each he
							puts down in the other altars; cattle have eight half-hooves; verily he

							verses, appertaining to Agni, for the Yajyas and Anuvakyas; in that
							they appertain to Agni, (the verses) are Agni's, in that they are
							Tristubhs (they are) Indra's; (verily they serve) for prosperity; he

							offered; verily he prospers in this world. It is (an offering) to
							Aditi; Aditi is this (earth); verily he finds support in this (earth);

							without keeping it in the pan for a year-(it is with him) as when an

							The fire is piled up for the world of heaven; the set of eleven stakes
							is a thunderbolt; if he were to set up eleven stakes in the fire, he
							would shut it off from the world of heaven with the thunderbolt; if he
							were not to set it up, he would sever the animals from the chips; one
							stake he sets up; verily he does not shut it off from the world of
							heaven, nor sever the animals from the chips. He who piling the fire
							steps down on it is deprived of power and strength; he should, with a
							verse addressed to Indra, put down a brick opposite his step; verily he
							is not deprived of power and strength. The fire is Rudra, his are three
							missiles, one that comes straight on, one that strikes transversely,
							and one that follows up. To them he is cut off who piles the fire;
							having piled the fire he should give (a bow) with three arrows to a
							Brahman, unasked; verily to them he pays homage, and also he ransoms

								Just as a son born dies, so dies he whose fire in the pan is

							in day and night came up to them. This is the colour of the Rc, the
							white of the skin of the black antelope; the black is the colour of the
							Saman. 'Ye are images of the Rc and Saman', he says; verily he wins the
							Rc and the Saman his offspring would be liable to the itch; if he were
							to smile, they would become naked. He scratches himself with the horn
							of the black antelope and smiles, holding it for the protection of his
							offspring. He should not let go the horn of the black antelope before
							the bringing of the gifts (to the priests). If he were to let go the
							horn of the black antelope before the bringing of the gifts, the womb
							of his offspring will be liable to miscarriage. When the gifts have

							The pit is the womb of the sacrificer; the horn of the black antelope
							is the womb; verily he places womb in womb, that the sacrificer may
							have a womb.

							Speech went away from the gods, not being willing to serve for the
							sacrifice. She entered the trees. It is the voice of the trees, the
							voice that is heard in the drum, the lute, and the flute. In that he
							offers the staff of the initiated, he wins speech. The (staff) is of
							Udumbara wood; the, Udumbara is strength; verily he wins strength. It
							is level with his mouth; verily from the mouth (downwards) he wins
							strength for him. Therefore from the mouth they enjoy strength and bear
							more hither', he says; verily he obtains innumerable cattle. 'Thou art
							gold; be for my enjoyment', he says; verily he takes each according to
							its deity. He says, 'To Vayu thee, to Varuna thee!' If he did not so
							specify them, he would put the gifts out of correspondence with the
							deities, and would be brought low to the deities. Because he thus
							specifies them, he puts the gifts in correspondence with the deities,
							and is not brought low to the deities. 'O divine waters, son of the
							waters', he says. 'That divine part of yours, which is pure and fit for
							the sacrifice, may I not step upon', that he says in effect. 'The
							unbroken web of earth may I follow', he says; verily making a bridge he
							crosses over.

							The gods, having fixed up a place of sacrifice, could not distinguish
							the quarters. They ran up to one another, (saying) 'By thee shall we
							distinguish them, by thee.' They fixed upon Aditi, (saying, 'By thee
							shall we distinguish them.' She said, 'Let me choose a guerdon. Let the
							opening oblation in the sacrifice be mine, and the concluding oblation
							be mine.' Therefore the opening oblation of the sacrifice belongs to
							Aditi, and the concluding oblation belongs to Aditi. He offers to five
							gods; there are five quarters, (and so it serves) for the distinction
							of the quarters. Verily the opening oblation should be performed with
							both fore- and after-offerings, and the concluding oblation should be
							performed both with fore- and after offerings. He does not omit the
							self, nor offspring; the sacrifice does not come to ruin, nor the
							sacrificer. He offers the concluding oblation in the scrapings of the
							opening oblation; this is the course of the sacrifice. Now if he were
							to make the Yajya verses of the opening libation the Yajya verses of
							the concluding libation, he would mount to the other world away from
							this, and would be liable to die. The Puronuvakya verses of the opening
							libation should be made the Yajya verses of the concluding libation;
							verily he finds support in this world.

							Kadru and Suparni had a dispute (for the stake of) each other's form.
							Kadru defeated Suparni. She said, 'In the third heaven from here is the
							Soma; fetch it, and by it buy your release.' Kadru is this (earth),
							Suparni yonder (heaven), the descendants of Suparni the metres. She
							said, 'For this do parents rear children; "in the third heaven from
							here is the Soma; fetch it, and by it buy your release". He buys Soma
							with a (cow) one year old; verily he buys it with the whole of speech.
							Therefore men utter speech when one year old. He buys with a cow which
							has no horns, small ears, is not one-eyed or lame, and has not seven
							hooves; verily he buys it with all. If he were to buy it with a white
							cow, the sacrificer would become leprous. If he were to buy with a
							black one, it would be a funeral cow, and the sacrificer would be
							likely to die. If with one of both colours, it would be one sacred to
							Vrtrahan, and he would either overcome his foe or his foe him. He buys
							with a ruddy, yellow-eyed one. This is the form of Soma; verily he buys
							it with its own deity.

							That became gold. Therefore they purify gold forth from the waters. The

							gold, placing it in the ghee, therefore are offspring produced, through
							that which is boneless, and yet are born with bones. The ghee is Agni's
							loved abode, the gold, is radiance. 'This is thy body, O pure one. This
							is thy splendour', he says; verily he unites Agni with his radiance and
							his body one of the gods; verily he places him below her, for guiding
							hither. He does as it were a harsh thing when he recites that (text) of
							Rudra's. 'In the path of Mitra', he says, for soothing. He buys indeed
							by speech when he buys by the cow with which the Soma is bought. Hail!
							Return with Soma as thy comrade, with wealth', he says, verily having
							purchased by means of speech, he restores speech to himself. The speech
							of him who knows thus is not likely to fail.

							He follows six steps. Speech does not speak beyond the sixth day. He
							wins speech in the size in which she is found in the path of the year.
							He offers in the seventh footprint. The Çakvari has seven feet, the
							Çakvari is cattle; verily he wins cattle. There are seven domesticated
							animals, and seven wild; there are seven metres to win both sets of
							animals. 'Thou art a Vasvi, thou art a Rudra', he says; verily thus by
							her form he expounds her greatness does not deprive himself of cattle.
							Saying 'Thine be wealth', he hands it to the sacrificer, and so bestows
							wealth on the sacrificer. Saying 'Thine be wealth', (the sacrificer
							hands it) to his wife. For a wife is the half of oneself, and to do so
							is as it were to deposit it in one's house. 'Let me attend on thee with
							Tvastr's aid', he says. Tvastr is the maker of the forms of offspring,
							of pairings; verily he places form in cattle. For this world the
							Garhapatya fire is piled up; for yonder world the Ahavaniya. If he were
							to cast it on-the Garhapatya fire, he would be rich in cattle in this
							world; if on the Ahavaniya, he would be rich in cattle in yonder world
							he casts it on both; verily he makes him rich in cattle in both worlds.

							were to clarify it, it would be as when one expels from the mouth what
							has been swallowed; if he were not to clarify it, it would be as when
							something falls upon the eye and moves to and fro; the Adhvaryu would
							be hungry, the sacrificer would be hungry. 'O Soma-seller, purify the
							Soma', he should say; so whether it be the one; verily he unites it
							with all the gods, the Soma is cattle; (with the words) 'For expiration
							thee', he ties it; verily he confers expiration upon cattle. (With the
							words) 'For cross-breathing thee', he looses it; verily he confers
							cross-breathing upon cattle; therefore the vital breaths do not desert

							If he were to barter (it) in response (to the words), 'Let me buy with

							the Soma not worth a cow, the sacrificer not worth a cow, the Adhvaryu
							not, worth a cow, but he would not depreciate the mightiness of the
							cow. 'With a cow let me buy from thee', verily he should say; verily he
							makes the Soma worth a cow, the sacrificer worth a cow, the Adhvaryu
							worth a cow, yet still he does not depreciate the mightiness of the
							cow. He buys (it) with a she-goat; verily he buys it full of fervour;
							he buys (it) with gold; verily he buys it bright, Bhraja', he says;
							they indeed in yonder world guarded the Soma; from them they grasped
							the Soma; if he were not to indicate to them those that serve as the
							price of Soma, he would not have purchased the Soma, and they would not
							guard the Sonia for him in yonder world. In that he indicates to them
							those that serve as the price of Soma, he really purchases the Soma,

							purchased in the right thigh of Indra; now the sacrificer is Indra;
							therefore he says thus. 'With life, with fair life', he says; verily
							seizing the gods. 'Honour to the radiance of Mitra and Varuna', he
							says, for atonement. They bring forward this Soma, it rests with Agni,
							they in uniting overpower the sacrificer. Now the consecrated person
							has for long been holding himself ready for the sacrifice. In that he
							offers an animal to Agni and Soma, that is a buying-off of himself;
							therefore of it he should not eat; for as it were it is a buying-off of
							a man. Or rather they say, 'By Agni and Soma Indra slew Vrtra'. In that
							he offers an animal to Agni and Soma, it slays hostile things for him;
							therefore he should eat of it. He honours it with a verse addressed to
							Varuna; verily he honours it with its own deity.

							If he should offer hospitality after unyoking both (the oxen), he would

							both, it would be as when hospitality is offered to one who has not yet
							arrived. One ox is unyoked, one ox is not unyoked; then he offers
							hospitality, for the continuance of the sacrifice. The wife (of the
							sacrificer) holds on (to the cart); for the wife is mistress of the
							household gear; verily he offers what is approved by the wife. The
							share of the wife in the sacrifice makes a pair; so the wife also,
							'There are both Agni and Soma here; why is hospitality offered to Soma
							and not to Agni?' In that having kindled fire he places it on the fire,
							by that verily is hospitality offered to Agni. Or rather they say,
							'Agni is all the gods.' In that he kindles fire after placing the
							oblation, he thus produces all the gods for the oblation when it has

							The gods and the Asuras were in conflict. The gods fell out among

							separated in five bodies, Agni with the Vasus, Soma with the Rudras,
							Indra with the Maruts, Varuna with the Adityas, Brhaspati with the

							that we are falling out among ourselves; let us remove (from us) and
							deposit together those bodies which are dear to us; from these shall he
							depart who, making Agni their protection, overcame the Asuras. Now he
							as it were enters Agni who undergoes the intermediate consecration,
							(and it serves) for the overcoming of his foes; he prospers himself,
							his foe is overcome. He protects himself by the consecration, his
							offspring by the intermediate consecration. The girdle he makes
							tighter; for his offspring are closer to him than himself. He drinks
							warm milk, and rubs himself with bubbling water; for fire is
							extinguished by cold, (and these serve) for kindling. 'Thy dread form,
							O Agni', he says; verily with its own deity he consumes the hot milk,
							for unity, for atonement.

							They made ready an arrow, Agni as the point, Soma as the socket, Visnu
							as the shaft. They said, 'Who shall shoot it?', the half-months number

							awl-shaped intermediate consecration who wishes, 'May there be
							prosperity for me in this world', (that is) one to begin with, then
							two, then three, then four; this indeed is the awl-shaped intermediate
							consecration; verily there is prosperity for him in this world. He

							they measure off and sacrifice on so much as they deem they can use.
							The back cross-line is thirty feet, the eastern line is thirty-six
							feet, the front cross-line is twenty-four feet. These make up tens; the

							impure. He digs up; therefore the plants perish. He spreads the
							sacrificial strew; therefore the plants again revive. He spreads over
							the strew the upper strew. The strew is the people; the upper strew is

							consecrated is a foetus, the consecration-shed is the womb (in which he

							sprinkles the high altar, verily thus does the sacrificer repel his

							they ate on the right of the high altar. Whatever is left of the
							sprinkling waters he should pour on the right of the high altar;
							whatever cruel is there that he appeases thereby. He should think of

							They obtained offspring. They having obtained offspring,' Return to us;

							taken up falls outside the enclosing-sticks, that is their portion;
							verily therewith be delights them. He reflected, 'My brothers of old
							perished because they had bones. I will shatter bones.' The bones he
							shattered became the Buteafrondosa, the flesh which died on them

							He loosens the knot; verily he sets them free from the noose of Varuna;

							verse to Savitr, he brings forward the oblation-holders; verily on the

							both sides is Varuna of evil speech; if it were to creak, it would
							creak against the house of the sacrificer. 'With fair voice, O god, do
							thou address the dwelling', he says; the dwelling is the house; (verily
							it serves) for atonement. The wife (of the sacrificer), with this Rc
							verse which contains a blessing he strikes in the prop of the southern
							oblation-holder; verily the sacrificer at the beginning of the
							sacrifice wins blessings. Now Danda Aupara split by the Vasat call the

							oblation-holder (serves) to make up the third oblation-holder, The
							oblation-holder is the head of the sacrifice. 'Thou art the forehead of

							head divided. 'Thou art the string of Visnu; thou art the fixed point
							of Visnu', he says, for the oblation-holder is connected with Visnu as

							'May our songs, O lover of song', he says; that is according to the

							strength does he put in it of the post is the part above the top; that
							is their share; verily by it he delights them. The gods when the Soma
							sacrifice was complete cast the offering-spoons (into the fire) and the
							post; they reflected, 'Here we are making a disturbance of the
							sacrifice', they saw a ransom in the bunch of grass for the
							offering-spoons, in the chip for the post. When the Soma sacrifice is
							complete he casts (in the fire) the bunch of grass, he offers the chip,
							to avoid disturbing the sacrifice.

							The Sadhya gods were in this world and nothing else living. They
							offered Agni as a sacrifice to Agni, for they found nothing else to
							offer; thence indeed these creatures were born; in that he casts the
							fire on the fire after producing it, (it serves for) the propagation of
							offspring. Now the fire is Rudra, the beast the sacrificer; if he were
							to produce the fire after offering the beast, he would place the
							sacrificer in the power of Rudra, 'For him who is being cast forward
							recite', he says; verily as each part is performed he completes him. He
							recites all Gayatri verses; Agni has the Gayatri as his metre; verily
							he unites him with his own metre. The fire is in front; having produced
							fire he casts it forward; the two uniting overpower the sacrificer; 'Be
							of one mind with us', he says, to appease (them). He offers after
							casting (the fire) forward; verily he gives him food on birth; he
							offers with melted butter; the melted butter is the dear home of Agni;
							verily he unites him with his dear home, and also with brilliance.

							'The priests, the eager ones', he says; the priests are the priests,
							the eager ones, therefore he says thus. 'O Brhaspati, guard wealth'
							thee, for the plants thee I sprinkle', be says, for from the waters,
							from the plants, the beast is born. 'Thou art a drinker of the waters',
							he says, for he is a drinker of the waters who is offered in sacrifice.
							'O ye divine waters, make it palatable, a very palatable offering for
							the gods', he says; verily he makes it palatable. From above he
							sprinkles (it); verily he makes it pure from above; he makes it drink;

							By means of Agni as Hotr the gods defeated the Asuras. Recite for Agni
							as he is kindled', he says, for the overcoming of foes. He recites
							seventeen kindling-verses; Prajapati is seventeenfold; (verily it
							serves) to win Prajapati. He recites seventeen; there are twelve months
							and seven seasons, that is the year; offspring are born in the course
							of the year; (verily it serves) for the propagation of offspring. The
							gods, after reciting the kindling-verses, could not discern the
							sacrifice; Prajapati silently performed. He chooses the priests, verily
							he chooses the metres, he chooses seven; there are seven tame animals,
							seven wild; there are seven metres, (and so it serves) to win both. He
							offers eleven fore-sacrifices; ten are the vital airs of the beast, the
							body is the eleventh; verily his fore-offerings are of the same size as
							the beast. One (of them) lies around the omentum; verily the body lies
							around the body. The axe is a thunderbolt, the splinter of the
							sacrificial post is a thunderbolt, the gods by making a thunderbolt of
							the ghee smote Soma. 'Anointed with ghee, do ye guard the beast', he
							says; verily, overpowering it by means of the thunderbolt, he offers

							beast is led to death; if he were to grasp hold of it, the sacrificer
							would be likely to die. Or rather they say, 'The beast is led to the
							world of heaven'; verily he pays homage to them. 'Come forward,
							irresistible', he says; the resisting is the foe; (verily it serves) to
							beat away the foe. 'Along the stream of ghee, with offspring, with
							increase of wealth', he says; verily he invokes this blessing. 'O ye

							earth; (with the words) 'Hail to the and night!' he pours it down;
							verily he removes the pain of the earth by day and night. 'O plant,
							protect him', 'O axe, harm him not', he says; the axe is a thunderbolt,
							for the completion of the sacrifice. The speckled butter is the
							expiration and inspiration of cattle, the omentum is the body; having
							poured butter on the speckled ghee,' he pours on the omentum; verily in
							the body of cattle he deposits expiration and inspiration. 'Hail! Go to
							Urdhvanabhas, the offspring of the Maruts', he says; Urdhvanabhas, the
							offspring of the Maruts, used to cast forward the omentum-forks of the
							gods; verily through him he casts them forward. He casts them forward
							in opposite directions; therefore expiration and inspiration are in
							opposite directions.

							in the beast. Having made offering of the speckled ghee, he thrice
							asks, 'Is the oblation cooked, Çamitr?' for the gods found truth in
							three (cookings). He who says what is not cooked is cooked (is
							burdened) with sin. The speckled butter is the expiration and the
							inspiration of cattle. He said, 'Let me choose a boon; let me have a
							choice part of the beast.' He chose that choice part (of the beast),
							the shoulder from the fore part, the intestines from the middle, the
							hip from the hind part. Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were
							defeated; in that he makes portions of three members it is for the
							overcoming of his foe; he prospers himself, his foe is defeated. He
							cuts off transversely; therefore cattle move forward their limbs
							transversely, for support.

							the rib; the rib is the middle of cattle, the fat is the sap of cattle;
							in that he stirs the oblation of fat with the rib, he places sap in the
							middle of cattle. Now they kill, in the middle the beast, last the
							speckled butter; therefore the fore-sacrifices are performed with
							butter, the beast (is offered) in the middle, and the after-sacrifices
							with speckled butter. Therefore that is mixed as it were, for it was
							created last. He offers eleven after-sacrifices; ten are the vital airs
							of the beast, the body is the eleventh; he offers as many
							after-sacrifices as is the size of the beast. Now they kill the beast
							when they dispose of it; the speckled butter is the expiration and the

							thick side; he cuts off without confusion, to prevent confusion of the
							vital airs. He does not turn (it) round; if he were to turn (it) round,
							disease would be likely to seize his offspring. 'Go to the ocean,
							hail!' he says verily thus he produces seed. if he were to place the
							heart-spit on the earth, he would cause pain to the earth; if on the
							waters, he would cause pain to the waters; he places it in the

							He takes the Vasativaris; the Vasativaris are the sacrifice; verily
							having taken from the beginning the sacrifice he stays (with it). If
							the sun set, on one who has not taken (the waters), his sacrifice would
							not be begun world he would have cattle. He places (them) on both;
							verily he makes him have cattle in both worlds. He carries (them) round
							everywhere, to smite away the Raksases. 'Ye are the share of Indra and
							Agni', he says; that is according to the text. He places (them) on the
							Agnidh's altar; the Agnidh's altar is the invincible part of the
							sacrifice; verily he places (them) on the invincible part of the
							sacrifice. Wherever in the performance of a sacrifice nothing is done,
							in that (place) the Raksases infest the sacrifice. In that he takes of

							eaten and drunk do not waste away. The pit is the birthplace of the
							sacrifice, the Vasairivaris are the sacrifice; bringing the bowls of
							the Hotr and the Maitravaruna into contact he pours in the Vasativaris
							reciprocally, so that the sacrifice may have its birthplace; verily he
							produces it from its own birthplace. 'O Adhvaryu, didst thou seek the

							If it is an Agnistoma, he makes a libation; if an Ukthya, he rubs

							he purifies him by means of these worlds. The theologians say, 'For

							The cup for Indra and Vayu is speech; in that the cups are drawn

							him sweet for us'. 'Thou art taken with a support', he says, and
							thereby have they Aditi for their deity, for those vessels that are
							made of wood are born from her womb, those that are made of clay are
							clearly hers; therefore he says thus. Speech aforetime spoke without
							discrimination; the gods said to Indra, 'Do thou discriminate this
							speech for us'; he replied, 'Let me choose a boon; let this (cup) be
							drawn for me and for Vayu together.' Therefore the cup is drawn
							together for Indra and Vayu. Indra approaching it in the midst
							discriminated it; therefore is speech spoken distinctly. Therefore is
							it drawn once, in the middle, for Indra, and twice for Vayu, for he

							therefore with a king as helper they slay a king, with a Vaiçya a
							Vaiçya, with a Çudra a Çudra. This was not day or night, but
							undiscriminated; the gods said to Mitra and Varuna, 'Make this to shine
							forth for us'; they replied, 'Let us choose a boon; let one cup only be
							drawn before ours.' Therefore the cup for Indra and Vayu is drawn
							before that for Mitra and Varuna, for the Upançu and the Antaryama
							(cups) are expiration and inspiration. Mitra produced the day, Varuna

							offspring. Savitr is among the gods he who is connected with the
							Gayatri; in that the Agrayana (is drawn), it is drawn in the world of
							the Gayatri; in that he draws (the cup) for Savitr from the Agrayana
							with the Antaryama vessel, verily he draws it off from its own
							birthplace. The All-gods. He draws Soma in Soma; verily thus he
							impregnates seed. 'Thou givest good protection, and art well
							established', he says, for he draws Soma in Soma, for support. In this
							same cup (offering) is made for men, gods, and Pitrs; 'Thou givest good
							protection, and art well established', he says; verily thereby he makes
							(it) for men; 'The great', he says; verily thereby he makes (it) for
							the gods; 'Homage', he says; verily thereby he makes (it) for the
							Pitrs; so many are the gods; verily he draws it for them all. 'This is
							thy birthplace; to the All-gods thee!' he says, for it is connected
							with the All-gods.

							The Upançu is the breath; in that the first and the, last cups are
							drawn with the Upançu-vessel, verily they follow forward the breath,
							they follow back the breath. The Agrayana is Prajapati, the Upançu is
							the breath, the wives produce offspring; in that he draws (the cup) for
							(Tvastr) with the wives from the Agrayana with the Upançu-vessel, (it
							serves) for the production of offspring. Therefore offspring are born
							in accordance with the breath. The gods desired that the wives should
							go to the world of heaven men do not give up even one worthy of death
							who has come for help. Therefore in (the cup) for the wives for Tvastr
							also a drawing is made. He does not put (the cup) down, for from what
							is not depressed offspring are produced. He does not utter the
							secondary Vasat; if he were to do so, he would let Rudra go after his
							offspring; if he were not to do so, the Agnidh would consume the Soma
							before it had been appeased; he says the secondary Vasat muttering, he
							does not let Rudra go after his offspring, the Agnidh consumes the Soma
							after it has been appeased. 'O Agnidh, sit on the lap of the Nestr; O
							Nestr, lead up the wife', he says verily the Agnidh impregnates the
							Nestr, the Nestr the wife. He causes the Udgatr to look (at the wife);
							the Udgatr is Prajapati; (verily it serves) for the production of
							offspring. He causes water to follow along; verily thus he pours seed;
							along the thigh he causes it to flow, for along the thigh is seed
							poured; baring the thigh he causes it to flow, for when the thigh is
							bared, they pair, then seed is poured, then offspring are born.

							Indra slew Vrtra; he forced out his skull-bone, it became the wooden
							tub, from it the Soma flowed, it became (the cup) for the yoker of
							bays; he reflected regarding it, 'Shall I offer, or shall I not offer?'
							He reflected, 'If I shall offer, I shall offer what is raw; if I shall
							not offer, I shall make confusion in the sacrifice.' He decided to
							offer; Agni said, Thou shalt not offer what is raw in me'; he mixed it
							with fried grains cattle would attend and wait on him; if he were not
							to crush them, many cattle would attend, but not wait on him; in his
							mind he crushes them together, and effects both; many cattle attend and
							wait on him. They await the invitation from the Unnetr; verily they win
							the Soma-drinking that is here. He throws down (the remnants) on the
							high altar; the high altar is cattle, (the grains) for the yoker of
							bays are cattle verily they make cattle find support in cattle.

						-
							Offspring and cattle are born through the cups, goats and sheep through
							the Upançu and Antaryama, men through the Çukra and Manthin,
							whole-hooved animals through the season-cups, kine through the Aditya
							cup. The Aditya cup is drawn with the largest number of Rcs; therefore
							kine axe the most numerous of cattle; in that he thrice draws apart
							with his hand the Upançu (cup), therefore the female goat gives birth
							to two or three, but sheep are more numerous. The Agrayana is the
							father, the tub is the son; if the Agrayana is exhausted, he should
							draw from the tub; that is as when a father (a man) is a slayer of a
							Brahman (through slaying) an embryo which has not been discriminated.
							They go to the final bath; they deposit the pots, but lift up (the
							vessels) for Vayu; therefore they deposit a daughter on birth, a son
							they lift up. In that be utters the Puroruc, it is as when one brings
							(something) to a superior; in that he draws the cup, it is as when
							having brought (something) to a superior one proclaims (it); in that he
							puts it down, it is as when having deposited something with a superior
							one goes away. Whatever of the sacrifice is accompanied by a Saman or
							Yajus, is loose; whatever by a Rc is firm; they are drawn with a
							support in front to the accompaniment of a Yajus, (they are drawn) with
							a support behind to the accompaniment of a Rc, for the support of the
							sacrifice.

							Some vessels are used (repeatedly), others not. With those that are

							world is as it were turned away (paran). With those which are used
							again he conquers this world, for this world is repeated as it were
							again and again. Some vessels are used (repeatedly), and others not.
							Through those that are used once only the plants fade; through those
							which are used again; he found no stay in himself; he saw these cakes
							,as an addition to the pressing, them he offered, and with them he made
							a stay in himself; therefore as additional to the pressing the cakes
							are offered; therefore as additional to the pressing he should partake
							of the cakes; verily he makes a stay in himself, and the Soma does not
							flow through him. The theologians say, 'Neither by Rc nor by Saman is
							the five made up; what then is the fivefold character of the
							sacrifice?' Fried grains, mush, rice grains, the cake, clotted milk,
							thereby the five is made up; that is the fivefold character of the

							The sacrifices with the gifts are offered for the world of heaven. He

							feet; (verily it serves) for support. He offers in the Agnidh's altar;
							verily he ascends the atmosphere. He approaches the Sadas; verily he

							for leading to the world of heaven. 'Go to the sky, fly to heaven',
							(with these words) he takes out the gold after the offering, he says in
							effect. He gives gold; gold is light; verily he places light before, to
							light up the world of heaven. He gives to the Agnidh; verily he
							delights the seasons headed by Agni; he gives to the Brahman priest,

							six; verily he delights the seasons; he offers three with Yajuses or on
							the lord of the sacrifice? He replied, 'On the lord of the sacrifice.'
							'But in truth Srñjayas have been defeated', he said, 'the sacrifice
							should have been made to rest on the sacrifice, to prevent the defeat

							injure the sacrifice; the Prastotr follows along with the Saman, the
							slayer of Raksases, is the Saman; (verily it serves) for the smiting
							away of the Raksases. Thrice he performs the finale; these worlds are
							three; verily from these worlds; if he were to partake of the drops, he
							would be possessed of cattle, but Varuna would seize him; if he were
							not to partake, he would have no cattle, but Varuna would not seize
							him; he should touch them only, he becomes possessed of cattle, Varuna
							seizes him not. 'The noose of Varuna is loosed', he says; verily is he
							freed from Varuna's noose. They advance without looking round, for
							concealment from Varuna. 'Thou art fuel may we prosper', he says;

							With the wooden sword he digs up the altar, with the axle of a chariot

							set it up within the altar, he would win the world of the gods; if
							outside the altar, the world of men; he sets it up in the place where
							the altar and the edge (outside) meet, for the winning of both worlds.
							He should set (the set) up with the lower parts alike for one who
							desires the world of the Pitrs, with the girdle part alike for one who
							desires the world of men, with the top pieces alike for one who desires
							power, and all alike for one who desires support; the three in the

							milks the eleventh breast of her. In that the set of eleven (is set
							up), a thunderbolt is set up; it is liable to crush the sacrifice face

							atonement. The metres of him who has sacrificed are worn out, the cow

							the Adabhya has its name. He who knows thus deceives his foe; his foe
							deceives him not. The Adabhya is the form of Prajapati, called the
							freer; he draws from (the Soma) which is tied up, for freedom; he who
							knows thus is set free from his evil foe. They kill the Soma in that
							they press it; in the slaying of the Soma the sacrifice is slain, with
							the sacrifice the sacrificer. The theologians say, 'What is it that the
							sacrificer does in the sacrifice whereby he goes alive to the world of
							heaven?' The Adabhya is the taking alive; he draws from (the Soma)
							before pressing; verily he makes him go alive to the world of heaven.
							Now they break the sacrifice asunder when they make it find support in

							The gods drew the cups in a line; Prajapati saw this Ançu, drew it, and

							drawn, prospers. He draws from (the Soma) when it has been once
							pressed, for once he prospered thereby. He draws with the mind, for
							Prajapati is mind as it were; (verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati.
							He draws with (a vessel) of Udumbara; the Udumbara is strength; verily
							he wins strength; it has four corners; verily he finds support in the
							quarters. He who knows the foundation of the Ançu becomes possessed of
							a foundation. The Saman is that called the Vamadevya; singing in his
							mind that foundation he draws; verily he becomes possessed of a
							foundation. If the Adhvaryu were not to make a success of drawing the
							Ançu, for both the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer would it go ill; if he
							were to make a success, for both would it go well; he draws without
							breathing; this is its success. He breathes over gold; gold is
							immortality, breath is life; verily with life he quickens immortality;
							it is of a hundred (Krsnalas) in weight, man has a hundred (years of)
							life, a hundred powers; verily in life, in power he finds support.

							Prajapati assigned the sacrifices to the gods; he thought himself

							sacrifice called Sodaçin; in that there is a sixteenth Stotra and a
							sixteenth Çastra, therefore is it the Sodaçin, and that is why the
							Sodaçin has its name. In that the Sodaçin is drawn, so the sacrificer
							bestows power and strength upon himself. To the gods the world of
							heaven; verily he wins four-footed cattle; two last; verily he wins
							two-footed (cattle); they make up an Anustubh; the Anustubh is speech,
							therefore speech is the highest of the breaths. When the sun is
							half-set, he sets about the Stotra of the Sodaçin; in this world Indra
							slew Vrtra; verily straightway be hurls the bolt against his foe. The
							sacrificial fee is a reddish-brown horse; that is the form of the bolt;

							Production of offspring is light. Agni is the light of the gods; the
							Viraj is the light of the metres. The Viraj of speech ends in Agni; it
							is produced according to the Viraj. Therefore it is called light. Two
							Stomas bear the morning pressing, like expiration and inspiration; two
							the midday pressing, like eye and ear; two the third pressing, like
							speech and support. This sacrifice is commensurate with man, and is

							others. Therefore the Çudra is not fit for the sacrifice, for he was
							not created after any gods. Therefore they depend on their feet, for
							they were created from the feet. The Trivrt is the breaths; the
							Pañcadaça the half-months; the Saptadaça Prajapati; these worlds are

							Soma found a thousand; Indra discovered it after him. Yama approached

							them, 'This one has the strength of the thousand, this be mine, the
							rest yours.' They said, 'We all see that in this one is strength should
							be beautiful, perfect in form; for she is a boon; (verily it serves
							for) prosperity. Leading her round to the north of the Agnidh's place
							he makes her smell the wooden tub near the Ahavaniya fire, saying,
							'Smell the tub, O great one, with broad stream rich in milk;

							Let the drops enter thee as the streams the ocean;

							Sarasvati, Priya, Preyasi, Mahi, Viçruti,
						-
						-
							These, O inviolable one, are thy names;

							not. The theologians say, 'Does the thousandth follow the thousand? or
							the thou sand the thousandth?' If he were to let her go to the east,
							the thousandth would follow the thousand; now the thousand has no
							understanding, and would not recognize the world of heaven. He lets her
							go to the west; the thousand follow after her. She knowing goes to the

							Atri gave offspring to Aurva who was desirous of children. She deemed

							splendour; the increasing Stomas are prosperity. Atri who had faith as
							his deity and offered sacrifices was not visited by the four strengths,

							were not distinguished. They saw this five-night rite. They grasped it
							and sacrificed with it. Then they were distinguished; verily he stands

							There is an Agnistoma characterized by the Trivrt (Stoma); verily he

							periods are seasonal periods. They are the children of the seasons, and
							therefore, splendour is connected with the Gayatri; verily in the

							Astacatvarinça; the Jagati has forty-eight syllables, cattle are

							accord in order of seniority; the younger does not overstep the older.
							He should draw the cup for Indra and Vayu first for one who is ill. For
							he who is ill is separated from breath, the cup for Indra and Vayu is
							breath; verily he unites him with breath. They should draw the cup for
							Mitra and Varuna first if when they are consecrated one die; verily
							with speech he yokes him. 'May we go not through thee to joyless
							fields', he says. The joyless fields are those of death; verily he goes
							not to the fields of death. He should draw full cups for one who is
							ill. Pain afflicts the breaths of him who is ill, the cups are breaths;
							verily he frees his breaths from pain, and even if his life is gone,
							yet he lives. He should draw full cups if rain does not fall. Pain
							afflicts the breaths of the people if rain does not fall, the cups are
							breaths; verily he frees the breaths of the people from pain, and rain
							soon falls.

							(The cup) for Indra and Vayu is connected with the Gayatri, the opening

							Prajapati desired, 'May I be propagated.' He saw this (rite) of twelve
							nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed was he
							propagated. He who desires, 'May I be propagated', should sacrifice
							with (the rite) of twelve nights; verily he is propagated. The
							theologians say, 'The sacrifices have Agnistomas at the beginning; why
							then is Atiratra first employed?' The two Atiratras are the eyes of the
							sacrifice, the two Agnistomas the pupils; if. The twelve nights' (rite)
							is Prajapati in twelve divisions. The two sides are the Atiratras, the
							eight Ukthyas within are the body; Prajapati in such guise touches
							truth with the Sattra, truth is the breaths; verily he touches the
							breaths. Those who perform the Sattra perform it with the breath of all
							people, and therefore they ask, 'Are these performers of a Sattra?'
							Dear to people and noble is he who knows thus.

							This (rite) with a Vaiçvanara on one side (only) was not able to win
							the world of heaven; it was stretched upwards and the gods piled round
							this Vaiçvanara, to overcome the world of heaven. The seasons made
							Prajapati sacrifice with it, and in them because of it he prospered. He
							prospers among the priests who knowing thus sacrifices with (the rite)
							of twelve days. They were desirous of obtaining (their desires) from
							him. He gave to the spring the sap, with the third three he cleanses
							the vessels, and with the fourth three he purifies himself within. He
							who eats his victim, eats his flesh, who eats his sacrificial cake,
							eats his brains, who eats his fried grain, eats his excrement, who eats
							his ghee, eats his marrow, who eats his Soma, eats his sweat, and also
							he eats the excrements from his head, who accepts (a present) at the
							twelve-day (rite). Therefore one should not cause one to sacrifice with
							the twelve-day (rite), to avert evil.

							They go swiftly in that it is the tenth day. In that it is the tenth
							day they loosen their sins. He who among men going swiftly falls in
							with a trackless way, he who strikes a post, and he who stumbles, are
							left out. So he, who on this tenth day, the Avivakya, comes to grief,
							is left out. If one points out (an error) to one who comes to grief, he
							seizes hold of him and comes out successfully, and then the one who
							pointed out (his error) is left out should point out (his error). If
							there be none there, then (the error) should be pointed out from within
							the Sadas. If there be none there, then it should be pointed out by the
							Grhapati. At any rate it should be pointed out. They sing the verses of
							the serpent queen on that day. The queen of what creeps is this
							(earth). Whatever on this (earth) they praise, whatever they have
							praised, through that is this (earth) the serpent queen. Now whatever
							they have praised with speech and what they will praise thereafter, (it
							is done thinking), 'Having won both and obtained them, let us stop.'
							They sing these (verses) with the mind. Neither a horse chariot nor a
							mule chariot can in one moment encompass this (earth), but mind can in
							one moment encompass it, mind can overcome it. Then they repeat the
							Brahman. The Rc verses are limited, the Samans are limited, and the
							Yajuses are limited, but of the Brahman there is no end, and that he
							should declare to the one who responds. That is the response.

							perform (the rite) of thirteen nights. They say, '(The rite) of twelve
							days is the sequence of speech. They would cleave it if they put an
							Atiratra in the middle, and the speech of the householder would be
							liable to fail.' They perform the Mahavrata after the Chandomas; verily
							they maintain the sequence of speech, and the speech of the householder
							is not likely to fail. The Chandomas are cattle, the Mahavrata food; in
							that they perform the Mahavrata after the Chandomas, they find support
							in cattle and in food.

							return (from heaven), and for support. Having prospered in either world
							they cease (the rite). The (nights) are fourteen. As for ten of them,

							Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of fifteen nights overcome

							days; the seasons are five in the year; verily in the seasons and the
							year they find sup port. Again the Pankti is of five elements, the
							sacrifice is fivefold; verily they win the sacrifice. There can be no
							Sattra where there is no Chandoma; in that there are Chandomas, there
							is the sacrifice. The gods they win by the Prsthas, the cattle by the
							Chandomas. The Prsthas are force and strength, the Chandomas cattle;
							verily in force and strength, and in cattle, they find support. (The

							(Brahman) and food, and became resplendent and eaters of food. Those,
							who knowing thus perform (the rite of) these nights, acquire both the
							holy power (Brahman) and food. If the Prsthas were on one side there
							would be a lack of balance; the Prsthas are in the middle, for balance.
							The Prsthas are force and strength; verily they place force and
							strength in the middle. They proceed with the Brhat and the Rathantara
							(Samans). The Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky);
							verily with them do they proceed, verily also in them they find
							support. These indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by
							them do they proceed to the world of heaven. They mount the world of

							Yonder sun was in this world. The gods surrounded it with the Prsthas

							with the Para (Samans), and placed it with the Divakirtya (Saman) in
							the world of heaven. They surrounded it from above with the Para
							(Samans), and with the Prsthas they descended (from heaven). Yonder sun
							indeed in yonder world is surrounded by the Para (Samans) on both
							sides. In that there are Prsthas the sacrificers go by them to the
							world of heaven; they surround it from below with the Para (Samans),
							and by the Divakirtya (Saman) find support, the sacrificers would
							either go mad or perish. In that the Prsthas are reversed they descend
							to this world with them; verily also they find support in this world,
							for sanity. Indra was unsettled. He ran up to Prajapati; he gave him
							this (rite) of twenty-one nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with
							it. Then indeed he became settled. Those, who sacrifice much and are
							unsettled, should perform (the rite) of twenty-one nights. There are
							twelve months, five seasons, three worlds here, and yonder sun as the
							twenty-first. So many are the worlds of the gods; verily in them in
							order they find support. Yonder sun did not shine. He ran up to
							Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of twenty-one nights; he grasped it,
							and sacrificed with it. Then in deed did he shine. Those, who knowing
							thus perform (the rite) of twenty one nights, shine also. (The rite) is
							of twenty-one nights, the Ekavinça (Stoma) is radiance; verily they
							attain radiance, and support also, for the Ekavinça is support. There
							are Atiratras on either side, for securing splendour.

							Brhaspati desired, 'May the gods have faith in me, and may I become
							their Purohita.' He saw this (rite) of twenty-four nights; he grasped
							it, and sacrificed with it. Then the gods had faith in him, and he
							became their Purohita. In those who knowing thus perform the twenty
							four night (rite) men have faith, and they become their Purohitas.
							There are the three days Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this
							(earth), the Go the atmosphere, and the Ayus yonder (sky) proceed;
							verily also in them they find support. These indeed are the quick paths
							of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the world of
							heaven. (The rite is one) of twenty-four nights. Twenty four
							half-months make up the year; the year is the world of heaven; verily
							they find support in the year, the world of heaven. Now the Gayatri is
							of twenty-four syllables; the Gayatri is splendour; verily by the
							Gayatri they win splendour. There are Atiratras on either side, to
							secure splendour.

							As are men, so were the gods in the beginning. They desired, 'Let us
							strike off the misfortune, the evil of death, and reach the conclave of
							the gods.' They saw this twenty-four night (rite); they grasped it, and
							sacrificed with it. Then they struck off the misfortune, the evil of
							death, and reached the conclave of the gods. Those who knowing thus
							perform the twenty-four night (rite) strike off the misfortune, the
							evil, and win prosperity, for the conclave of the gods is in the case
							of man proceed to the world of heaven. They mount the world of heaven
							turning away (from earth) who perform the Prsthas in succession. The
							six-day (rite) is reversed for the return (from the heaven), and for
							support. Having prospered in either world they cease (the rite). They
							go from a Trivrt to a Trivrt, for the attainment of the Stomas, for pre
							eminence. There is an Agnistoma in the Jyotis form. This dwelling is
							this (world); verily by reason thereof they depart not from this
							dwelling. (The rite is one) of twenty-four nights. Twenty-four
							half-months make up the year, the year is the world of heaven; verily
							they find support in the year, the world of heaven. Now the Gayatri is
							of twenty-four syllables; the Gayatri is splendour; verily by the

							This (earth) was bare and hairless. It desired, 'Let me be propagated

							propagated with plants and trees. Those who desire offspring and cattle
							should perform (the rite of) these (nights); they are propagated with
							offspring and cattle. This (earth) was hungry. It saw this Viraj, and
							placing it within itself it won food, plants. Those who knowing thus
							perform (the rite of) these (nights) have both offspring and cattle.
							These go imperfect to the world of heaven, for they resort to various
							Stomas; in that the Stomas are arranged in order, they go in order to
							the world of heaven, and there is order in both these worlds. These
							(nights) are thirty in number, the Viraj has thirty syllables; verily
							by the Viraj they win food. There are Atiratras on either hand, to

							Prajapati went to the world of heaven. But with whatever metre the gods
							yoked him, they achieved not him. They saw (the rite of) these
							thirty-two nights. The Anustubh has thirty-two syllables, Prajapati is
							connected with the Anustubh; verily having gained Prajapati by his own
							metre they mounted on him and went to the world of heaven. Those who
							knowing thus perform (the rite of) these thirty-two (nights)--the
							Anustubh has thirty-two syllables, Prajapati is connected with the
							Anustubh-gaining Prajapati by his own metre, go to prosperity. The
							Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky); verily with them do
							they proceed; verily also in them they find support. These indeed are
							the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the
							world of heaven. Those who perform the three days in succession mount
							upon the world of heaven turning away (from earth). There is a three
							day period reversed, for returning (from heaven), and also for support.
							Having prospered in both worlds they cease (the rite). These (nights)
							are thirty-two. As for thirty of them, the Viraj has thirty syllables,
							the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj they win food. As for the
							(remaining) two, they are days and nights, and by both forms they go to
							the world of heaven. There are Atiratras on either side, for security.

							There are two Sattras of the gods, that of twelve days and that of
							thirty-three days. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite of)
							thirty-three days, mount openly upon the deities. As a great man who
							has reached (the goal) seeks (more), so he does. If he fail he becomes
							worse; if he fail not, he remains the same. Those, who knowing thus
							perform (the rite of) thirty-three days, are distinguished from the
							evil enemy. The gods in the beginning seized these (nights), sharing
							the days by means of a ten-nights' (rite) did Prajapati create
							offspring. In that there is a ten-nights' (rite), the sacrificers
							create offspring. Udanka Çaulbayana has declared the ten-night rite to
							be the prosperity of the Sattra. In that there is a ten-nights' rite,
							(it serves) for the prosperity of the Sattra. Verily also whatever is
							wrongly done in the former days, it serves to atone. These nights form
							two rows, the sacrificers are the Viçvajit, the first are sixteen with
							the Atiratra, the second are sixteen with the Atiratra. To those, who
							knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirty-three days, are born children
							in two rows. There are Atiratras on either side, for security.

							The Adityas desired, 'Let us go to the world of heaven.' They discerned
							not the world of heaven, they went not to the world of heaven. They saw
							this (rite) of thirty-six nights; they grasped it, and sacrificed with
							it. Then indeed did they discern the world of heaven, and went to the
							world of heaven. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirty
							six nights, discern the world of heaven, and go to the world of heaven.
							The Atiratra is light and strength they find support. (The rite has)
							thirty-six nights; the Brhati has thirty-six syllables, cattle are
							connected with the Brhati; verily by the Brhati they win cattle. The
							Brhati obtained the sovereignty over the metres. They obtain
							sovereignty who knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirty-six nights;
							verily they go to the world of heaven. There are Atiratras on either
							side, for the securing of the world of heaven.

							Vasistha, his sons slain, desired, 'May I win offspring, and defeat the
							Sauddsas.' He saw this (rite) of forty-nine nights; he grasped it, and
							sacrificed with it. Then indeed did he win offspring and defeated the
							Sauddsas. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of forty-nine
							nights, win offspring and defeat their enemies. There are three
							Agnistomas with the Trivrt; verily they sharpen the point of the bolt.
							There are ten Pañcadaças; the bolt is fifteenfold. There are many
							Sodaçins, for conquest. There are six (days) with the Açvina (Çastra),
							six are the seasons; verily they rest on the seasons. These nights are
							deficient and redundant. They are deficient in that they are fifty less
							one, redundant in that they are (one) more than forty-eight. Both from
							the deficient, indeed, and from the redundant Prajapati was propagated.
							Those who desire offspring and cattle should perform (the rite of)
							these nights; verily are they propagated with offspring and cattle.
							This sacrifice is connected with the Viraj because it is one of
							forty-nine (nights). Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of
							forty-nine nights, attain the Viraj, and become eaters of food. There
							are Atiratras on either side, for the securing of food.

							Those who are about to consecrate themselves for the year (rite) should
							consecrate themselves on the Ekastaka. The Ekastaka is the wife of the
							year; on that night he dwells with her; verily they consecrate
							themselves grasping openly the year. Those who consecrate themselves on
							the Ekastaka consecrate themselves in the troubled part of the year,
							for then are the two months called the end. Those who consecrate
							themselves on the Ekastaka consecrate themselves on the torn part of
							the year, for them are the two seasons called the end. They should
							consecrate themselves on the full moon in Phalguni. The full moon in
							Phalguni is the beginning of the year the pressing-(day) falls on the
							first half (of the month), the months end in the first half, they
							complete (the rite) in the first half, and when they complete the rite
							the plants and trees come out after them. And after them follows the
							fair report, 'These sacrificers have succeeded', and therefore all
							succeed.

							They go to the world of heaven who perform the Sattra. They kindle
							themselves with the Diksas, and cook themselves with the Upasads. With
							two they cut off their hair, with two their skin, with two their blood,
							with two their flesh, with two their bones, with two their marrow. In
							the Sattra the self is the sacrificial gift; verily taking the self as
							the gift they go to the world of heaven. They cut off the top-knot, for
							prosperity, (thinking), 'More swiftly may we attain the world of
							heaven.'

						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 4: Verse 10
					-
						-
							The theologians say, 'The Atiratra is the highest of the forms of
							sacrifice. Why do they perform it first?' Now in doing so they really
							perform in order first the Agnistoma, then the Ukthya, then the
							Sodaçin, then the Atiratra, all the forms of sacrifice, and seizing and
							holding them, they keep drinking the Soma. They perform the Jyotistoma
							first; the Jyotistoma is the beginning of the Stomas; verily they
							commence the Stomas from the beginning. The Stomas being sung together
							make up the Viraj, and two verses are redundant; the Gostoma has one
							too many, and the Ayustoma one too few. The Jyotistoma is the world of
							heaven, the Viraj is strength; verily by it they go to the world of
							heaven. 'The Rathantara is used in the day, the Rathantara at night',
							say the theologians, 'what is used to avoid repetition?' The great
							Saman of Sobhari is used as the Brahmasaman at the third pressing; it
							they place in the middle, to separate them; verily there is no
							repetition.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 4: Verse 11
					-
						-
							They first perform the Jyotistoma; verily by it they find support in
							this world. They perform secondly the Gostoma; verily by it they find
							support in the atmosphere. They perform thirdly the Ayustoma; verily by
							it they find support in yonder world. The Jyotis is this (earth), the
							Go the atmosphere, and the Ayus yonder (sky). In that they perform
							these Stomas, the performers of the Sattra keep finding support in
							these worlds. These, (Stomas) being sung together make up the Viraj.
							Therefore (the days) follow man. There are three Sadahas, they make up
							eighteen days, nine and nine. Nine are the breaths in man; verily they
							follow the breaths. There are four Sadahas, they make up twenty-four
							days. The year consists of twenty-four half-months; verily they follow
							the year. 'The year is not fixed', they say. 'It is greater than a
							support.' The Brahmana of the month is that of the year also verily
							they go finding support in each month.

							The cows performed that Sattra, being hornless, with the desire, 'May
							horns be born to us.' For ten months they performed it, and then horns
							were born, and they ceased (the rite), (saying), 'We have obtained (our
							desire).' Then those whose horns were not born ceased (the rite) after
							making up the year, (saying), 'We have obtained (our desire).' Both
							those which obtained horns and those which did not ceased, (saying),'We
							have obtained (our desire).' The year is the cows' Sattra; verily as
							they go on they find support in the year. There are three hundred and
							sixty Stotriyas; so many are the nights of the year; verily they attain
							both forms of the year.
						-
						-
							They perform (the rites of) the next days for rest, for safety. There
							are six-day periods. The year has six seasons; verily they find support
							in the seasons, the year. The Go and the Ayus (Stomas) are the Stomas
							in the middle; verily they place a pair in the middle of the year.
							There is used the same Saman. The Saman is the world of the gods;
							verily they leave not the world of the gods. There are used various
							verses. The verses are the world of man; verily they keep mounting one
							world of gods after another from the world of men. There is the
							Brahman's Saman as the Abhivarta to win the world of heaven. There is
							the Abhijit (day) for the gaining of the world of heaven. There is the
							Viçvajit (day) for the gaining of all. Month by month they perform the
							Prsthas, month by month the Atigrahyas are drawn; verily in each month
							they place strength, for the support of the months. They perform the
							Prsthas in the latter part of the month. Therefore it is on the top
							that the plants bear fruit.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 5: Verse 2
					-
						-
							The cows performed that Sattra, being hornless and desiring to obtain
							horns. For ten months they performed it, and then horns appeared. They
							said, 'We have gained (them), let us cease (the rite), for we have
							attained the desire for the sake of which we began (the rite).' But
							others said, either half of them or as many as might be the case, 'Let
							us perform (the rite) for these months, the eleventh and the twelfth,
							and when we have made up the year, let us cease'. In their case their
							horns grew in the twelfth month. Whether by faith, or by lack of
							faith-that is, those which have no horns-both indeed were prosperous,
							those which gained horns and those which won strength. He who ceases
							after ten months is prosperous, and he who ceases after twelve also, if
							he knows thus. They go by their feet, and he who goes by his foot
							attains (what he seeks). The Ayana is successful, and therefore is it
							productive of cows.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 5: Verse 3
					-
						-
							They perform the Prahas in the first month, they perform them in the
							middle month, they perform them in the last month. They say, 'In the
							case of a cow which they milk thrice a day, she yields sparingly at the
							latter two milkings; how then can she be milked who is twelve times
							milked?' Having made up the year, they should perform the Prsthas once
							in the last month; verily the sacrificers win the sacrifice and cattle.
							It is an ocean without a near or a further shore that they enter upon
							who perform the year (rite). If they employ the Brhat and the
							Rathantara Samans, it would be as if they were to provide a boat in the
							middle of the ocean. Going continuously with the Brhat and the
							Rathantara they obtain support. The union is milked for all desires;
							thus the sacrificers obtain all desires.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 5: Verse 4
					-
						-
							The Rcs are the same. The Rcs are the world of men; verily they leave
							not the world of man. There are different Samans; the Saman is the
							world of the gods; verily they descend from the world of the gods to
							one world after another of men. They first use the Jagati, and the
							metres descend from the Jagati, the cups from the Agrayana, the Prsthas
							from the Brhat, the Stomas from the Trayastrinça. Therefore the younger
							descends before an elder. The Viçvakarman cup is drawn; verily by it
							the sacrificers win all rites. The cup for Aditi is drawn. Aditi is
							this (earth); verily they rest on this (earth). The one and the other
							are drawn, for pairing, for propagation. Of old Prajapati created
							offspring by means of the ten-night (rite); in that the ten-night rite
							is performed, the sacrificers create offspring. Udanka Çaulbayana has
							declared the ten-night rite to be the prosperity of the Sattra, and the
							ten-night rite serves for the prosperity of the Sattra. Verily also
							whatever is done wrongly in the earlier days, this serves to atone for
							it.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 5: Verse 5
					-
						-
							If two libations are offered simultaneously, then one should perform
							the early litany in the advanced part of the night. He who does it
							first wins the speech, the gods, and the metres (of the others). The
							strophe should contain the word 'strong (vrsan)'; verily he takes Indra
							away from their morning pressing. Or rather they say, 'The strophe at
							the beginning of each pressing should be of this kind'; verily he takes
							Indra away from each of their pressings.
						-
						-
							For entry, for rest, for the overcoming, of the Gayatri, of the
							Tristubh, of the Jagati, of the Anustubh, of the Pankti, hail!
						-
						-
							Entry and rest are the metres; verily by the metres, he takes away
							their metres. One should recite the Sajaniya hymn; one should recite
							the Vihavya hymn; one should recite the Kayaçubhiya hymn of Agastya.
							This indeed is so much as that, verily he takes away so much as is
							theirs. If at the early pressing the bowl is broken, they should sing
							verses addressed to Visnu and containing the epithet Çipivista.
							Whatever in the sacrifice is redundant, is redundant with regard to
							Visnu Çipivista; verily Visnu Çipivista places the redundant in the
							redundant. Verily having obtained the redundant by the redundant, they
							win it. If it is broken at the midday pressing, they should make the
							Saman have the Vasatkara as its finale. The support of the sacrifice is
							the Vasatkara; verily they make the Saman obtain support. If it breaks
							at the third pressing, the same thing (should be done).

						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 5: Verse 6
					-
						-
							Having made up the month with the six-day periods they leave out a day,
							for they behold the months by the six-day periods. Having made up the
							months with the half-months, they leave out a day, for they behold the
							months by the half-months. Having made up the months by the new moon
							night, they leave out a day, for they behold the months by the new moon
							night. Having made up the months by the full moon night, they leave out
							a day, for they behold the month by the full moon night. He who pours
							(liquid) into a full (vessel) wastes the liquid; he who pours out from
							a full (vessel), who leave out the day. The Samnayya is the fourth
							pressing. Because there is the Samnayya, they do not leave the
							pressing. They partake of it after uttering the invocation, for they
							have this then as their Soma drink. The deities who share in the
							pressings of those who leave out the day go to their places; they offer
							the sacrificial cakes in each of the pressings; verily they win the
							deities who share in the pressing from their several places. (They
							offer the cakes) on eight potsherds at the early pressing, on eleven
							potsherds at the midday pressing, and on twelve potsherds at the third
							pressing; verily they obtain and win the metres. They offer an oblation
							to the All-gods at the third pressing. The third pressing belongs to
							the All-gods; verily they leave not the third pressing.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 5: Verse 7
					-
						-
							The theologians consider, 'Should (a day) be left out, or should it not
							be left out?' They say, 'It should be left out.' They say, 'It should
							be left out at the new moon and at the full moon, for these two guide
							the sacrifice.' 'These two must not be left out,' they say, 'for these
							two determine the dependent sacrifice.' '(The day) should be left out
							on the first Vyastaka,' they say, 'for this is what rends the month.'
							They should not leave out a day which is appointed. The third pressing
							belongs to the All-gods with the Rbhus. In that they offer to the
							All-gods a cake on twelve pot sherds, they make the gods share in it,
							and they approach the pressing with twelve. They offer a beast to
							Prajapati-Prajapati is the sacrifice that the sacrifice may not be
							abandoned. For six months (as they go) hence the Brahman's Saman should
							be the 'victorious'. The 'victorious' is the holy power (Brahman);
							verily they go winning the world of heaven by the holy power (Brahman);
							for the world of heaven is as it were opposite from hence. When they
							come thence the Brahman's Saman for six months should be 'O Indra, bear
							us strength, as a father to his sons. Guide us, O thou that art much
							invoked, on our path. Living, may we attain the light.' The light is
							this world, the light is offspring; verily they come, gazing on this
							world by repeating the verse.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 5: Verse 8
					-
						-
							When the gods had come to the end, their power and strength departed.
							They won them again by the Kroça (Saman), and that is why the Kroça has
							the name. In that they sing the Kroça at the end of the pit, they win
							power and strength at the end of the sacrifice. They sing the Sattra
							syarddhi (Saman) at the end of the Ahavaniya; verily, making Agni a
							witness, they advance to prosperity. They sing the Prajapater Hrdaya
							within the shed; verily they win his favour. They sing the Çloka
							(Saman) in front of the Sadas they place glory in themselves. Therefore
							one breath protects all the limbs. Therefore, just as a bird about to
							fly upwards raises its head aloft, so the sacrificers are highest among
							people. The Udgatr mounts a throne; verily they attain rule. The Hotr
							(mounts) a swing; verily they mount the back of the firmament. The
							Adhvaryu (mounts) two mats; verily they reach the surface of the ruddy
							one. So many indeed are the worlds, and in them in order they find
							support. Then the sacrificers make thus a bridge to mount, for the
							gaining of the world of heaven.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 5: Verse 9
					-
						-
							By means of the Arkya (Saman) Prajapati created offspring in thousands.
							From them by means of the Ilamda (Saman) he took away the food they had
							gathered. In that there is the Arkya, the sacrificers create offspring;
							in that there is the Ilamda, they take away from the offspring which
							has been created the food they have gathered. Therefore, in whatever
							year the Sattra is performed, the offspring are hungry in that year,
							for they take their food and strength; in whatever year the Sattra is
							imperfect, the offspring are not hungry in that year; for they take not
							their food and strength. They raise a loud noise. As men being freed
							from bonds cry aloud, so the sacrificers freed from the bonds of the
							gods cry aloud, placing food and strength in themselves. The lute has a
							hundred strings. Man is of a hundred (years) of age, and of a
							hundredfold strength; verily they find support in age and strength.
							They run a race, to win what has not yet been won. They beat drums; the
							voice of the drum is the highest (form of) speech; verily they win the
							highest (form of) speech. They beat the earth-drum; verily they win
							that speech which has entered this (earth); verily also they conquer
							the earth. All (forms of) speech they utter, to gain all (forms of
							speech). Two strive on a dry hide, to gain strength. One reviles,
							another extols. He who reviles purifies them, he who extols places food
							in them after they are purified. They win by the first months what is
							done by the Rsis and by the gods; in that the Bhutechad Samans are
							used, both are gained. Those who perform the year rite lose their
							virility. There are a pair united within the sacrificial ground; verily
							they lose not virility.
						-
					-
						Section 2 - Black: Book 7: Chapter 5: Verse 10

						-
							They pierce the hide; verily they remove the sin of the (sacrificers).
							'Do not miss, do not pierce through', he says; verily they now remove
							their sin. Slave girls dance round the Marjaliya fire with water-pots
							on their heads, beating the ground with their feet, and singing 'This
							is honey.' Honey indeed is the chiefest food of the gods; verily they
							win the chiefest food. They beat the ground with their feet; verily
							they endow the (sacrificers) with might.

							Now for the fire which is produced on the fire-altar and for Soma, the
							king, the beast for Agni and Soma is the guest-offering. Again the fire
							which is piled up is cruel, and if one were not to cast upon the fire
							which has been piled up these oblations, the cruel fire would spring up
							in wrath, and injure the offspring and cattle of the sacrificer. In
							that he casts the oblations on the fire which has been piled up, he
							appeases it with its own portion, and the cruel fire. In that he casts
							these oblations, (it is) for the winning of the quarters. The gods made
							Indra sacrifice with it, and therefore is it Indra's pressing; men made
							Manu sacrifice with it, and therefore is it Manu's pressing. As Indra
							among the gods, as Manu among men, becomes he who knowing thus
							sacrifices with this sacrifice. The Puronuvakyas contain the word
							'quarter', for the conquest of the quarters.

							He who knows the head of the sacrificial horse becomes possessed of a

							the quarters, the ribs the intermediate quarters, the winking the day
							and night, the joints the half-months, the joinings the months, the
							limbs the seasons, the trunk the year, the hair the rays (of the gun),
							the form the Naksatras, the bones the stars, the flesh the mist, the
							hair the plants, the tail hairs the trees, the mouth Agni, the open
							(mouth) Vaiçvanara, the belly the sea, the anus the atmosphere, the
							testicles the sky and the earth, the membrum virile, the
							pressing-stone, the seed the Soma. When it chews, there is lightning;
							when it moves about, there is thundering; when it makes water, there is
							rain; its speech is speech. The Mahiman (cup) indeed is born before the
							birth of the horse as the day. The Mahiman (cup) is born after it as
							the night. These two Mahiman (cups) surround on either side the horse.
							As Haya (steed) it carried the gods, as Arvan (courser) the Asuras, as
							Vajin (racer) the Gandharvas, as Açva (horse) men. The birthplace of
							the horse, indeed, is the sea, its kindred is the sea.
