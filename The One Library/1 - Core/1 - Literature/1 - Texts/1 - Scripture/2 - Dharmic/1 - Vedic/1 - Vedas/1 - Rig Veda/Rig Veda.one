				-
					-
						I WILL declare the manly deeds of Indra, the first that he achieved, the

					-
					-
						He slew the Dragon, then disclosed the waters, and cleft the channels of
						the mountain torrents.
					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 32: Verse 2
				-
					-
						He slew the Dragon lying on the mountain: his heavenly bolt of thunder
						Tvastar fashioned.
					-
					-
						Like lowing kine in rapid flow descending the waters glided downward to the
						ocean.
					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 32: Verse 3
				-
					-
						Impetuous as a bull, he chose the Soma and in three sacred beakers drank
						the juices.
					-
					-
						Maghavan grasped the thunder for his weapon, and smote to death this
						firstborn of the dragons.
					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 32: Verse 4
				-
					-
						When, Indra, thou hadst slain the dragon's firstborn, and overcome the

					-
						Then, giving life to Sun and Dawn and Heaven, thou foundest not one foe to

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 32: Verse 5
				-
					-
						Indra with his own great and deadly thunder smote into pieces Vrtra, worst

					-
					-
						As trunks of trees, what time the axe hath felled them, low on the earth so

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 32: Verse 6
				-
					-
						He, like a mad weak warrior, challenged Indra, the great impetuous

					-
					-
						He, brooking not the clashing of the weapons, crushed--Indra's foe--the
						shattered forts in falling.
					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 32: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Footless and handless still he challenged Indra, who smote him with his
						bolt between the shoulders.
					-
					-
						Emasculate yet claiming manly vigour, thus Vrtra lay with scattered limbs
						dissevered.
					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 32: Verse 8
				-
					-
						There as he lies like a bank-bursting river, the waters taking courage flow

					-
					-
						The Dragon lies beneath the feet of torrents which Vrtra with his greatness

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 32: Verse 9
				-
					-
						Then humbled was the strength of Vrtra's mother: Indra hath cast his deadly

					-
						The mother was above, the son was under and like a cow beside her calf lay
						Danu.
					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 32: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Rolled in the midst of never-ceasing currents flowing without a rest for

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 32: Verse 11
				-
					-
						Guarded by Ahi stood the thralls of Dasas, the waters stayed like kine held

					-
						But he, when he had smitten Vrtra, opened the cave wherein the floods had
						been imprisoned.
					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 32: Verse 12
				-
					-
						A horse's tail wast thou when he, O Indra, smote on thy bolt; thou, God

					-
					-
						Thou hast won back the kine, hast won the Soma; thou hast let loose to flow
						the Seven Rivers.
					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 32: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Nothing availed him lightning, nothing thunder, hailstorm or mist which had

					-
					-
						When Indra and the Dragon strove in battle, Maghavan gained the victory for

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 32: Verse 14
				-
					-
						Whom sawest thou to avenge the Dragon, Indra, that fear possessed thy heart

					-
					-
						That, like a hawk affrighted through the regions, thou crossedst
						nine-and-ninety flowing rivers?
					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 32: Verse 15
				-
					-
						Indra is King of all that moves and moves not, of creatures tame and

						Come, fain for booty let us seek to Indra: yet more shall he increase his

						Will not the Indestructible endow us with perfect knowledge of this wealth,

				-
					-
						I fly to him invisible Wealth-giver as flies the falcon to his cherished

					-
					-
						With fairest hymns of praise adoring Indra, whom those who laud him must

				-
					-
						Mid all his host, he bindeth on the quiver: he driveth cattle from what foe

				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 33: Verse 4
				-
					-
						Thou slewest with thy bolt the wealthy Dasyu, alone, yet going with thy

					-
					-
						Far from the floor of heaven in all directions, the ancient riteless ones

						Fighting with pious worshippers, the riteless turned and fled, Indra! with

				-

						They met in fight the army of the blameless: then the Navagvas put forth

						They, like emasculates with men contending, fled, conscious, by steep paths

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Whether they weep or laugh, thou hast o'erthrown them, O Indra, on the

						The Dasyu thou hast burned from heaven, and welcomed the prayer of him who

				-
					-
						Adorned with their array of gold and jewels, they o'er the earth a covering

					-
						Although they hastened, they o'ercame not Indra: their spies he compassed

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 33: Verse 9
				-
					-
						As thou enjoyest heaven and earth, O Indra, on every side surrounded with

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 33: Verse 10
				-
					-
						They who pervaded earth's extremest limit subdued not with their charms the

					-
						Indra, the Bull, made his ally the thunder, and with its light milked cows
						from out the darkness.
					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 33: Verse 11
				-

						The waters flowed according to their nature; he raid the navigable streams

						Indra, thou helpest Kutsa whom thou lovedst, and guardedst brave Dagadyu

					-
						Tvastar gave yet more force to thine appropriate strength, and forged thy

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 52: Verse 8
				-
					-
						When, Indra, thou whose power is linked with thy Bay Steeds hadst smitten
						Vrtra, causing floods to flow for man,
					-
					-
						Thou heldst in thine arms the metal thunderbolt, and settest in the heaven

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 52: Verse 9
				-
					-
						In fear they raised the lofty self-resplendent hymn, praise giving and

					-
					-
						When Indra's helpers fighting for the good of men, the Maruts, faithful to
						mankind, joyed in the light.
					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 52: Verse 10
				-
					-
						Then Heaven himself, the mighty, at that Dragon's roar reeled back in

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 52: Verse 11
				-

						O Indra, were this earth extended forth tenfold, and men who dwell therein

				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 52: Verse 12
				-
					-
						Thou, bold of heart, in thine own native might, for help, upon the limit of

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 52: Verse 13
				-
					-
						Thou art the counterpart of earth, the Master of lofty heaven with all its

				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 52: Verse 14
				-

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 52: Verse 15
				-
					-
						The Maruts sang thy praise in this encounter, and in thee all the Deities

				-
					-
						WE will present fair praise unto the Mighty One, our hymns to Indra in

				-
					-
						Giver of horses, Indra, giver, thou, of kine, giver of barley, thou art

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 53: Verse 6
				-
					-
						These our libations strength-inspiring, Soma draughts, gladdened thee in

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 53: Verse 7
				-
					-
						Thou goest on from fight to fight intrepidly, destroying castle after

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 53: Verse 8
				-
					-
						Thou hast struck down in death KaraÃ±ja, Parnaya, in Atithigva's very

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 54: Verse 11

				-
					-
						WHY hath the Best, why hath the Youngest come to us? Upon what embassy

					-
					-
						We have not blamed the chalice of illustrious birth. We, Brother Agni,

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 161: Verse 2
				-
					-
						The chalice that is single make ye into four: thus have the Gods commanded;

				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 161: Verse 3
				-
					-
						What to the envoy Agni in reply ye spake, A courser must be made, a chariot

						A cow must be created, and the Twain made young. When we have done these

					-
				-
					Mandala 1: Hymn 161: Verse 4
				-
					-
						When thus, O Rbhus, ye had done ye questioned thus, Whither went he who

					-
				-

				-
					-
						Ye by your wisdom brought a cow from out a hide; unto that ancient Pair ye

				-
					-
						On the high places ye have made the grass for man, and water in the

				-

						As, compassing them round, ye glided through the worlds, where had the

				-
					-
						The trial-fork of the flesh-cooking caldron, the vessels out of which the

				-

						If one, when seated, with excessive urging hath with his heel or with his

				-
					-
						Of Tvastar's Charger there is one dissector,--this is the custom-two there

				-
					-
						Wondrously first he rose aloft, defiant, in the Bull's lair, the homeof

					Mandala 4: Hymn 30: Verse 4
				-
					-
