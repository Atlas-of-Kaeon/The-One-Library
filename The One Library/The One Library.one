		-
			The One Library is a public service project which serves to archive and curate various
			resources in the public domain, which range from major historical texts to open source
			digital assets.

				Contents
			-
				-
					The Core
				-
					-
						The Core section of the One Library contains all of the Library's plain
						text written documents, including its archived texts and references for
						them.
					-
				-
					The Collection
				-
					-
						The Collection Section of the One Library contains all of the Library's
						assets that are not plain text documents.
						
						In addition to its digital asset archive, it also contains links to various
						external archives, references to external assets, commentary on the
						contents of the core.

			-
				Format
			-
				-
					All of the written documents in the library have been mapped to the ONE and
					ONE+ text formats, which is where the One Library gets its name from.
					
					ONE uses minus signs and tab indentation to separate text into a hierarchy of
					"blocks" without relying on any escape characters.
					
					ONE+ is a superset of ONE which provides more ways to encode text blocks, and
					is thus easier to write manually.
					
					This format allows the documents to be easily read as plain text, to clearly
					convey the structure of their content, and to be easily scraped by computer
					programs.
					
					The documents in the library will generally follow a convention where a
					"Philosophy" section is used to state the overall purpose of the document, and
					a "Principles" section in used to contain the main content of the document.
					
					The text of said documents will generally be wrapped at one hundred characters,
					assuming the width of each tab is four characters.
				-
			-
				Spliced Content
			-
				-
					Many of the documents in the library were originally written in languages other
					than English.
					
					As such, the library will generally use the most universally respected English
					translations of them.
					
					If there is no clear standard for an English translation of a given text, the
					library may use a custom amalgamation of various translations.
					
					Occasionally, it may use one standard for the text itself and a different
					standard for the layout of the text.
				-
			-
				Motto
			-
				-
					The motto of the One Library is "Love of Wisdom".
				-
			-
				Disclaimer
			-
				-
					Some of the texts contained within the library contain sensitive and
					controversial content that may understandably offend some people.
					
					The One Library does not condone any form of discrimination, hatred, violence,
					or supremacy.
					
					However the One Library does hold that even the most sinister of texts must be
					preserved so that we may learn from them and from their impact on history. To
					destroy or censor them would be akin to book burning, and, as it is commonly
					said, where books are burned, people will also be burned in the end.
